According to PwC, 72% of business executives say that AI will give them a  competitive advantage in the future1. In fact, in many ways the future is already here. Several  repetitive  and  simple  tasks  that  were  typically  performed  by  humans  are  now  being  automated by AI bundled with other technologies, such as cloud systems, augmented reality,  (social) robots, IoTs, and wearables. Consequently, the ratio of tasks executed by machines to  humans is dramatically shifting. Human workers are rapidly being replaced with AI on many  fronts. For instance, in 2018 an average of 71% of total task hours were performed by humans  compared to 29% accomplished by machines. However, this average is expected to shift  dramatically in the near future with 58% of tasks hours expected to be performed by humans  and the remaining 42% to be handled exclusively by machines by 20222.     In a world of such rapid technological changes, it is paramount to have an overview of the  research being conducted in this discipline. Such an understanding of current developments  of AI and associated technologies enables us to envision the future workplace and its effect  on  human  employees.  These  insights  also  provide  guidance  to  employees,  teams,  organizations, and governments in creating a sustainable and synergistic workplace. Finally,  engaging in this research allows us to proactively counter any negative effects that may arise  from the changes in the work settings. Through this minitrack, we hope to create a platform  where researchers working on AI in the context of future of work can come together and  create collaborations that will allow them to capitalize on each other’s work.    SHORT MINI-TRACK DESCRIPTION   This minitrack focuses on the impact of AI on the various aspects of the workplace as it exists  currently as well as how it may evolve in the future. We seek papers that address the social,  technical, behavioral, attitudinal, emotional, or managerial aspects of AI in the workplace. The  unit of analysis can be individuals, teams, or organizations. All kinds of research are welcome  including but not limited to quantitative, qualitative, conceptual, or design-oriented research.    1 Bothun, D., Liebermann, M., and Rao, A.

Geneva: World Economic  Forum.http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2018.pdf      The focus of these papers can range from the impact of AI on work and its related aspects to  the design considerations of AI in the workplace. In short, this minitrack seeks to highlight  research that may influence the future of work and act as a springboard for new ideas and  innovations in AI that will be disruptive to the workplace. The first minitrack at HICSS-54 was  highly successful and attracted several submissions despite the pandemic. The online session  held was also very successful with approximately 38 attendees at its peak.    The “AI and the Future of Work” minitrack is especially interested in the following topics:  1.  Power shifts between humans and AI   2.  AI and employees’ mental and physical wellbeing   3.  Shift in social/role identities with the introduction of AI   4.  Required skill set for human employees in an era of AI  5.  AI and the changing face of leadership   6.  Social relationships and AI at the workplace  7.  Integration of AI and work practices (knowledge sharing, decision making,  etc.)  8.  Ethical considerations of AI at the workplace   9.  Financial and economic implications of AI implementation in the workplace  10. The changing meaning of work or work-life balance in an era of AI   11. AI task appropriateness   12. Designing AI for the workplace   13. AI and changes in work settings   14. Workplace Analytics and AI  15. AI and creativity in the workplace    ORGANIZATION SUPPORT  University of South Florida (USF) and Renmin University of China endorse the minitrack chairs  both in terms of infrastructure and finances to organize this minitrack.    MARKETING   The minitrack will be promoted on social media platforms such as LinkedIn (e.g., dedicated  groups like “Machines as Teammates”), Twitter and Facebook as many academics are active  on these platforms. In addition, we will be reaching out to a list of individuals who attended  the  minitracks  “Machines  as  Teammates”,  “Social  &  Psychological  Perspectives  in  Collaboration Research”, and “Creativity: Research & Practice” in previous years. The call for  papers will be sent to the AIS email list server to reach the community of IS scholars. Further,  we will distribute the call for papers and promote the minitrack at conferences, workshops  and seminars that we will attend.

Much of this diverse data in unstructured and structured forms has a high business value and, if properly utilized, can become an important organizational asset. It contains various information about customers, competition, labor market, and development trends for industries, products and services, as well as the public and political mood. For innovative and sustainable development, it is essential for organizations to utilize this data to increase sales, identify future opportunities and new markets, outperform the competition, enhance products and services, recruit talent, improve operations, perform forecasting, protect the brand, and identify areas for improvement to name a few. However, many organizations make a limited use of this valuable data available to them either because they lack necessary tools or do not understand the value of this data. The main objective of this minitrack is to provide organizations a theoretical, conceptual, and applied grounded discussion of Business Intelligence and Big Data (BI & BD) to aid in innovative and sustainable development as well as effective decision-making. This minitrack addresses the following topics:  What is the substance (nature) of BI & BD? What is the added-value of BI & BD to development of organizations and their decision-making process? How to support organizational creativity, innovation and decision-making using BI & BD? How to design intelligent information systems and build decision support systems based on BI & BD?  How to use BI & BD tools and solutions to achieve innovative and sustainable development of organizations?  Thus, the Business Intelligence & Big Data for Innovative and Sustainable Development of Organizations minitrack invites papers focused on, but not limited to: Theoretical foundations for BI & BD development BI & BD to improve innovative and sustainable development of organizations Challenges and opportunities of applying BI & BD for innovative and sustainable development of organizations Development of BI & BD analytics capability BI & BD driven strategies BI & BD-enabled business transformation Business value of BI & BD BI & BD engineering for business model innovation Practical approaches, solutions, methods, and tools to foster innovative and sustainable development of organizations by using of BI & BD Cognitive technologies in organizations Social networks The discussion undertaken under this minitrack will accelerate the convergence process of various disciplines such as strategic management, computer science, database and data warehouse technologies, computational intelligence and soft computing, psychology, and social sciences. It seeks to revitalize scientific discussion and to establish closer cooperation with international research centers dealing with BI & BD use in organizations. This minitrack will discuss how to improve innovative development and decision-making in organizations by using BI & BD, and ultimately the functioning of the entire socio-economic system. Journals for fast track opportunities Information Systems Management (in progress) In 2019 Dr. Olszak and Dr. Zurada were guest editors of the special issues of the Information Systems Management (ISM) journal. This special issue was already published in Fall 2020 and contains 5 papers which represent an enhanced and extended versions of papers presented in our mini-track at HICS-52. In 2020, Drs. Olszak, Zurada and Kozanoglu were guest editors of the special issue of ISM again. It contains 6 enhanced and extended versions of articles from our mini-track at HICSS-53. The papers have already been published online. We need to consult with the editor-in-chief, Dr. Janice Sipior, whether she would like us to be the guest editors for the third time in a row for papers that will be presented at HICSS-54 and HICSS-55.

We need to use many of our methods and tools more intelligently to adapt to a new environment. Taleb’s 2007 ‘Black Swan’ phenomenon forces us to collaborate with people, companies and organizations totally differently from traditional ways. IoT, AI, Intelligent Systems, Cyber Physical Systems and their roles become much more important in a ‘socially-distanced’ society. COVID-19 has brought new challenges and opportunities to our daily lives. We need new forms of digital collaboration tools, we need new ways to collaborate and we need new core values and methods of collaboration – which triggers the quest to redesign collaboration tools and methods.  Information Systems and Information Technology have for a long time played a major role in supporting sustainability goals and a substantial research strand on “green IS/IT” has existed for many years. However, motivated by observing positive side effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as positive ecolocical effects through less travel and more virtualized collaboration, we believe that there are many more and not yet understood effects IT and IS can have on ecological and social sustainability goals, particularly through the virtualization of communication and collaboration. While there are obvious advantages, there are also downsides and challenges which require research activities to detect, understand, and mitigate those. Integration of people, processes, and information systems across organizational and national borders enables productive teamwork towards achieving mutual goals. People involved should be motivated to enter into collaborative projects and interactions, which lead to satisfaction and performance. Quality in collaboration is fostered by perception of value, trust, and commitment among participants and stakeholders. With progress in globalization and AI technology, many of these collaborations are conducted across widely dispersed organizations and national borders. Cross-system integration and intelligent collaboration technologies play crucial roles and often decide about IS project success or failure. Additional complexity and dynamics evolve through digital innovation activities in which collaborators, across organizations, countries, and cultures, work on new digital products, services, and business models – changing the way how innovation success is shaped. Growth in virtual collaboration can be facilitated by organizations seeking to gain competitive advantage by lowering costs, increasing knowledge, and reaching new customers. Perceived value serves as a stimulus for further growth.  Possible contributions regarding the cross-organizational and cross-border collaboration may include, but are not limited to the following: Processes of international and inter-organizational collaboration in IS/IT projects and operations Effects of collaboration on IS/IT performance Conceptual frameworks of IS/IT collaboration across organizations and borders Motivating factors for IS/IT collaboration External pressures and environmental factors influencing IS/IT collaboration Methodologies for studies of IS/IT collaboration Development and validation of IS/IT collaboration instrument  IS/IT collaboration studies at country, industry, firm, project, team or individual level  Challenges of managing cross-organizational/cross-cultural agile teams Comparative cross-country research on IT/IS collaboration Industry-specific and organization-specific case studies on IT/IS collaboration Managing IS/IT outsourcing and offshoring/nearshoring relationships Out-tasking and crowdsourcing in IT/IS contexts Valuing investments in IS/IT collaboration Cross-organizational and international IS/IT project management  Multinational teams and their cultural and leadership factors IT/IS-enabled Open Innovation approaches Cross-organizational innovation approaches and processes AI applications on collaboration of global virtual teams Collaboration cases on Big-Data analytics for creating customer value Social Collaboration using online social networks across countries Sustainability enabled and facilitated through digital collaboration The role of digital collaboration for impact sourcing and other forms of sustainability-focused outsourcing engagements SME case studies on social innovations and sustainability  Proposed Minitrack Chairs (PRIMARY Contact Person) Ilsang Ko (Chonnam National University) Room BUS 2-221 77 Yongbong-Ro, Buk-Gu Gwangju, South Korea +82-10-9603-2711    Daniel Beimborn (University of Bamberg) An der Weberei 5 96045 Bamberg, Germany daniel.beimborn@uni-bamberg.de  We believe that the mini-track, which has been successful during the HICSS 2006 through HICSS 2021 meetings, will provide a forum for researchers interested in this topic and can make the HICSS conference the preferred meeting point for this kind of research.  JOURNAL AND CONFERENCE COVERAGE ON THE TOPIC OF IS/IT COLLABORATION AND ITS PAYOFFS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY  We will Guest-edit a Special Issue of Sustainability; 2022  We Guest-edited a Special Issue of European Journal of Information Systems; Volume 19(2) April 2010.  We Guest-edited a special issue of Electronic Markets, 22(1) March 2012.  Regarding the topic of Cross Organizational and Cross Border IS/IT Collaboration, several journals publish articles related to this topic, including: International Journal of Project Management Information and Management MIS Quarterly European Journal of Information Systems Journal of Management Information Systems  Information Systems Research Information Systems Journal Journal of AIS Communications of ACM Communications of AIS International Journal of Information Management  The topic of Cross Organizational and Cross Border IS/IT collaboration is also covered by conferences such as ICIS, AMCIS, PACIS, and INFORMS  Several journals focus particularly on the global aspects of IS/IT. They include: Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries Journal of Global Information Technology Management Journal of Global Information Management  In summary, in leading journals and conferences, the topics in our mini-track proposal are current and growing. Yet those papers usually only partially address the track’s research issues. There is a need for a consistent quality publication and presentation outlet for research on IS/IT collaboration and its payoffs in the global economy.  4.  MARKETING OF THE MINI-TRACK  This mini-track will seek broad set of perspectives and research frameworks and encourages innovative ideas. For this mini-track a pool of authors has been developed who are motivated and interested in it. We will encourage these established authors and others to be involved in this track which is celebrating the tenth anniversary. We now have experienced a good number of submissions to the mini-track from year to year. We will encourage authors to send their abstract to mini-track chairs ahead of time if they would like feedback on your proposal for a paper.   Many of the papers from prior HICSS mini-tracks in this series have been published in journal special issues edited by the mini-track co-chairs, which has given this mini-track visibility and access to a larger group of authors as well as reviewers. Further motivation is our continuous effort for special issues. We have a large database of reviewers and potential authors. For HICSS-55 2022 we plan to try to grow the size of the community involved in the mini-track by: Inviting the authors who previously submitted to our HICSS 2006 through HICSS 2021 mini-tracks, JITTA special issue, two International Journal of e-Collaboration (IJEC) special issues, EJIS special issue, and Electronic Markets (EM) special issue to submit papers Encouraging the reviewers, who reviewed the papers for our HICSS mini-tracks, JITTA special issue, two IJEC special issues, EJIS and EM special issues, to submit their own papers Inviting a larger number of colleagues working in the field to submit papers       BIOGRAPHIES OF CO-CHAIRS  Ilsang Ko is Professor of Management Information System, College of Business Administration, Chonnam National University.

Most  organizations  and  networks  or  collaborating  have  experienced a substantial increase in the amount of telework and technology- mediated  collaboration  these  days.  The  pandemic  has  accelerated  the  organizational  practices  of  employees  and  members  collaborating  across  multiple spatial and temporal boundaries in complex configurations comprised  of multi-team arrangements, complex dependency relationships, and multiple  organizational boundaries. Sometimes referred to as telework, coordinating  task work and teamwork over a web of communication and information sharing  networks continues to serve as an important locus for research opportunities.  In addition, the pandemic has accelerated practices of remote education,  online shopping, virtual conferences, distributed social events, and many other  unique adaptations to this historic period. The implications are profound from  every perspective – economic, environmental, social, efficiencies, etc.  Contemporary  collaborative  work  can  rarely  be  studied  from  the  perspective of single teams because work units are often comingled into larger  organizational  networks  embedded  in  multi-team  internal  and  external  systems,  operating  in  multiple  locations  across  diverse  functions.  Most  business, government and scientific projects and processes today also have a  very prominent virtual dimension. Virtual collaborators often do not have the  same first language, come from different national cultures, work in different  time  zones  and  may  be  employed  by  different  organizations,  and  enter  collaborations with different expectations for group processes. Collaborators  often come and go from one project to the next and from one team to another.  These differences and multiplex view of collaboration networks present unique  opportunities for management and leadership. Research on virtual teams,  distributed collaboration, telework, organizations and networks is necessarily  multi-disciplinary in order to address the key challenges collaborators face,  while accounting for the complex context in which such collaborations occur.  Thus, we encourage submissions that may inform practice and research in  distributed collaboration through a variety of academic lenses and highlight  methodological  issues  and  innovation  in  the  study  of  virtual  teams,  organizations, and networks. This minitrack invites papers that offer direct and  indirect insights into the successful operation of virtual teams, distributed  collaboration, organizations and networks, including research in the vein of  computer  supported  collaborative  work  (CSCW),  computer  supported  collaborative  learning  (CSCW),  telework  and  social  and  organizational  networks. The topics we propose for this minitrack include but are not limited  to:    •  Spatial and temporal separation and its effects on collaboration  •  Coordination in collaboration across multiple boundaries  •  Coordination and dependency networks  •  Team knowledge networks quantitative and visual analysis  •  Impacts and consequences of telework on organizational and network  outcomes  •  Cultural differences in perception of time  •  Conflict management across cultures  •  Project management styles and differences across cultures  •  Differences in language understanding and its effects on collaboration  •  Power distance and its effects on collaboration  •  Uncertainty (risk) avoidance and its effects on collaboration  •  Anonymity in multicultural teams  •  eLeadership  •  Deception in virtual teams  •  Multi-team systems  •  Social loafing in virtual teams  •  Personality and its role in virtual teams  •  Cross-cultural training  •  Virtual team collaboration and innovation  •  Emotion in virtual teams  •  Relationship building in virtual teams  •  Information sharing in virtual teams  •  Collaboration and communication processes and tools  •  Differences between academic and non-academic virtual teams  •  Virtual team and collaboration case studies  •  Social Network Theory and Analysis  •  Identifying multi-level influences on virtual teams, organizations, and  networks  •  Scientific collaboration in virtual teams (Team Science)  •  Methodological advances on network science and graph analytics  Minitrack Relevance  This minitrack is expected to draw significant attention from academics and  practitioners because of its relevance to management of global collaboration  and virtual teams. These topics have routinely been included in minitrack  sessions at major conferences in the past few years including HICSS, ICIS,  AMCIS, ICGSE, ICSE, RE, and DSI. In addition, several studies of global virtual  teams and social/knowledge networks have been reported in publications such  as  Communications  of  the  ACM,  MIS  Quarterly,  Journal  of  Management  Information Systems, Management Science, Organization Science and Journal  of Computer Information Systems.  There is also considerable interest in this topic elsewhere. A short list of  interest in this area follows:     1. A recent survey of 752 IEEE members conducted by IEEE Spectrum and The  New York Times discovered that ""just 9 percent of 133 respondents whose  organizations  currently  offshore  R&D  reported  'No  problem'.  The  biggest  headache was 'Language, communication, or culture' barriers, as reported by  54.1 percent of respondents."" (http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/feb07/4881)     2. In a March 2007 web poll conducted by the Computing Technology Industry  Association ""nearly 28 percent of the more than 1,000 respondents singled out  poor  communications  as  the  number  one  cause  of  project  failure"".  (http://www.comptia.org/pressroom/get_pr.aspx?prid=1227)     3. Nilay Oza et. al. in their study Critical Factors in Software Outsourcing: A  Pilot Study of top Indian outsourcing firms named cultural differences and  language as the 2 most difficult among the 5 difficulty factors identified in  outsourcing relationships.     4. In their 2006 study presented at the International Conference on Software  Engineering Critical factors in establishing and maintaining trust in software  outsourcing  relationships, Nguyen,  Babar,  and  Verner  identified  communication and cultural understanding as the 2 factors most critical to  maintaining trust relationships.     5.  Huang  and  Trauth  identified  three  themes  as  major  cross-cultural  challenges: ""...the complexity of language issues in global virtual work, culture  and communication styles and work behaviors, and cultural understandings at  different  levels.""  (Cultural  influences  and  globally  distributed  information  systems development: Experiences from chinese IT professionals)    6. Thomas and Inkson report in “Cultural Intelligence: Living and Working  Globally” (2nd edition 2009) that “Even when people come from the same  culture, interpersonal skills are often poor, and this weakness is costly to  business.  Where  interpersonal  interaction  is  taking  place  across  national  boundaries, the potential for misunderstanding and failure is compounded.”    7. Boden et al report that “with increasing globalization, distributed software  teams have become fairly common. Usually companies that offshore their  software development expect a reduction of costs and access to new markets.  However, distributed teams often face problems related to globally distributed  work’s spatial, temporal, and cultural barriers.” (Operational and Strategic  Learning in Global Software Development” IEEE Software, Nov-Dec 2010. DOI:  10.1109/MS.2009.113)    One of the minitrack co-chairs, Derrick Cogburn, led a multi-institutional NSF- funded  team  under  the  Virtual  Organizations  as  Sociotechnical  Systems  (VOSS) program; he also worked with the Association of Southeast Asian  Nations (ASEAN) to build a virtual graduate institute on disability and public  policy  (http://idppglobal.org/,  and  teaches  graduate  seminars  on  cross- cultural collaboration in global virtual teams.    Marketing plan    We plan to market the minitrack as follows    •  We will aggressively market the minitrack through the various academic  and  professional  associations  of  the  co-chairs.  These  associations  include (AIS, Academy of Management, INGRoup,  Science  of  Team  Science,  International  Communication  Section  –  ISA,  Information  Technology  Section  –  APSA,  Global  Internet  Governance  Academic  Network, and Association of Internet Researchers). The four of us have  extensive network of colleagues in the fields of computer supported  collaborative  work  (CSCW),  geographically  distributed  collaborative  learning, management and information technology, international service  and international communication, both in the United States and globally.  •  In addition, we will contact by email everyone that submitted a paper  for or attended the minitrack in between the years of 2009 - 2021 and  invite them to submit a paper for 2022.  •  Encourage authors of this year's submissions to forward the email to  potentially interested colleagues.  •  Contact anyone who submitted a paper for another track which could as  well have been submitted for our minitrack on Distributed Collaboration  and Telework in Organizations and Networks.   •  Contact personal acquaintances working in academia and elsewhere and  ask them to submit a paper and to spread the word.  •  Advertise  through  traditional  academic  channels  such  as  ISWorld  listserv.  •  Publish the call for papers by submitting it -- insofar as this is possible  -- to the same lists as calls for papers for other, similar conferences such  as ICGSE, RE, etc    Minitrack chairs:     Derrick L.

Collaboration has the potential to boost the performances of data scientists towards generating real value  in identifying relevant problems or questions, representing and integrating data from a multitude of  sources, making sense of the data and information, and communicating their findings that can be easily  used across different roles in a business or organization. The new actionable knowledge and insights  gained is in turn expected to support achieving collaborative goals such as innovation, idea generation,  decision making, negotiation, and problem solving. Data science can also provide valuable insights on  collaboration.    As the complexity of business problems increase, there is a continued interest in looking for ways to  increase value of data science and use it to address business challenges. Encouraging and facilitating  collaboration in data science both within and across groups and organizations is one promising way for  businesses and organizations to enhance their operational excellence or competitive advantages. For  example, businesses are applying data science to help engage customers and improve operational  efficiency, and using collaborative technologies to support corporate knowledge management as well as  collaboration and communication among employees. Another example is collaborative generation and  creation of ideas and solutions through crowdsourcing and online communities. Furthermore, the  collaboration is not limited between humans and organizations but include that between humans and  computers as well. For example, human knowledge and expertise can provide guidance in building  computational models or in search of effective solutions to business problems more efficiently. In  addition, the application of methods from data science can help understand and improve patterns in digital  collaboration.    Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:    Collaborative data science  Data science for collaborative work (decision making, problem solving, negotiation, and  creativity/innovation)  Human-guided knowledge discovery   Humans in the loop data science  Human-machine collaboration in data science  Collaborative analysis of big data   Collaboration for social impact of data science  Collaborative collection, representation, and integration of big data  Collaborative management of heterogeneous data  Visualization of collaborative big data  Data science for collaboration in virtual teams  Inter-organizational collaboration in data science  Collaborative crowdsourcing analytics  Security and privacy issues in collaborative data science  Social and psychological issues in collaborative data science  Trust in collaborative data science  Ethical and legal issues in collaborative data science  Case studies on collaborative data science  Social media driven collaborative data science  Network analysis in collaborative data science  Best practice for collaboration in data science  Challenges and opportunities of collaboration for data science    While the topic of data science has been covered by many conferences, to our knowledge, there is a  dearth of track/mini-tracks that focus on data science in the context of collaboration. Based on our review  of recent industry trends, there is a lot of buzz around analytics and collaboration which is lacking in  academia. We propose to address this gap by offering a mini-track on collaboration that will focus not  only on big data and analytics but also on the entire gamut of research topics on data science in digital  collaboration.    The co-chairs of the proposed mini-track have significant experience in organizing tracks and mini-tracks  in national and international conferences such as AMCIS, HICSS, and pre-ICIS workshops. Dr. Zhou  served as a Program Chair of IEEE Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics. She also served  as a Program Vice Chair of IEEE/ACM Conference on Web Intelligence, among others. Through those  multiple experiences, she has a wide reach to researchers to seek good quantity of quality work to submit  to this mini-track. In addition, the co-chairs will contact journal editors such as Decision Support Systems,  Data Base for Advances in Information Systems to seek a special issue on this topic to even enhance  quality submissions. Souren Paul is co-chaired ICIS 2020 and AMCIS 2015. He will co-chair ICIS 2023.  He has co-chaired a mini-track on technology-mediated collaborations in healthcare at the Hawaii  International Conference on Systems Sciences (HICSS) since 2010. In addition, he has co-chaired mini- tracks on virtual teams at the Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS) for six years. He  also co-chaired mini-tracks on cognition and knowledge sharing in collaborative technology supported  group work at HICSS in 2005 and 2007.     At the current time, each organization of the Mini-track Chairs endorses their involvements with HICSS  and at least one or more will pay for their respective mini-track co-chair’s travel and registration cost to  attend HICSS.

MINI-TRACK DESCRIPTION FOR PROGRAM ANNOUNCEMENT  COVID-19  clearly  demonstrated  the  importance  and  prevalence  of  collaboration  technologies.  It radically changed the way we work and the frequency of use of various  collaboration technologies.  For over a decade, this mini track has examined the design,  development, and evaluation of collaboration technologies.  The recent pandemic has  demonstrated the impact of collaboration on organizational performance and has proven  to be more critical than strategic orientation or market and technological turbulence.   Successful collaboration is often difficult. Groups and teams often need to overcome both  physical and metaphorical distance. Other challenges include groupthink, dominance, lack  of  efficiency,  lack  of  focus,  overwhelming  information,  differing  motivations,  and  uncertainty.     The challenge for researchers and practitioners alike is to design sustainable processes  and systems within and between organizations that allow people, groups, teams and  machines to collaborate successfully. This challenge has many dimensions that cross  technical, behavioral, social, emotional, economic, and political boundaries. This mini-   3  track invites papers that address the theory, design, development, deployment, and  evaluation of collaboration processes and systems within and between organizations,  groups, teams, and machines.

Students, businesses, politicians and everyone is looking for safe virtual solutions. In addition, emerging issues like big data, data analytics, visual analytics, data mining, crowd--sourcing, e-government, e-health and m-commerce are giving new meaning to distributed decision making. Coordination among individuals with varying skills distributed across is becoming common.  Gartner group predicts that Swarm teams will become norm in the future. Given the global nature of world economy, outsourcing is becoming a norm creating temporary or swarm teams. Companies are no longer providing long-term contracts but are renewing them based on deliverables from outsourced companies. This is putting tremendous pressure on teams to deliver quality product on time at a reasonable cost. Team adaptability and team configuration are becoming crucial to meet deadlines. Teams must be able to adapt quickly to the changing environment be it face-to-face, mobile or in the cloud. Agile teams adapt and deliver quickly and provide maximum customer satisfaction. By definition, however, agile teams must be co-located. Can distributed teams be agile and adaptable? This requires careful team configuration. This mini-track examines the emerging issues related to team configuration and performance in distributed environment.  Some research related to outsourcing of structured tasks has been done, but research related to emerging issues like diversity, cohesiveness, agility and adaptability related to group collaboration across semi or unstructured tasks is still emerging. In addition, cloud computing is making it feasible to provide computing services at a reasonable cost. As cloud computing diffuses, decision making either individually or in a group using resources on the clouds is not far behind. Cloud computing will provide tremendous opportunities to distributed groups to make any time any place decisions at a reasonable cost.  In addition, the “e (Internet)” to “m (mobile)”  to “c (cloud) transformation is creating exciting opportunities for groups to make real time decisions in a mobile  possibly in the cloud environment . Distributed teams, however, face many challenges of time, location, infrastructure, language, customs, socialization and politics. This is further compounded in globally distributed teams by diversity, nationality and cultural issues. As old issue are resolved, new challenges emerge that require knowledge from multiple disciplines such as information systems, social sciences, international management, leadership and political science. It is almost impossible for one individual to have expertise in so many domains, which makes this a very challenging but ultimately rewarding collaborative area of research. Given the richness and research potential of this area, it is essential to brainstorm and bring diverse points of view to develop underlying theory and frameworks. The mini track will attempt to accomplish these objectives. b) Chair(s): Dr. A. K. Aggarwal**  1420  410 837-5275  Dr. Doug Vogel Harbin Institute of Technology, PRC  Dr. Yuko Murayama Tsuda University, Japan    Topics The mini track will address emerging issue such as diversity, culture, adaptability and agility related to teams in distributed group decision making, as well as the underlying theories of group dynamics, coordination, communications and decision-making in distributed environments, in creation of competitive advantage.  Since team configuration and performance includes many different areas, we expect contributions from researchers beyond information system discipline.  Examples of topics in the discussion of globally distributed decision making mini-track will include the following (but are not limited to):  eCollaboration during pandemic Challenges of moving from face to face to virtual settings during pandemics Disaster planning during pandemic Comparison of platforms like Zoom, Teams, Webex for decision making Fake news impact on ecollaboration eCollaboration in distributed teams Disaster management Swift team collaboration Sub groups impact on eCollaboration Big data collaboration E-government(s) inter- , intra-collaboration  Collaboration through crowdsourcing Delivering health services through collaboration Economics of distributed decision making in the clouds Trust and distrust as motivator in distributed decision making Can agile teams be globally distributed? Agile/Adaptable team configuration in globally distributed teams The “e (internet)” to “m (mobile)” transformation of globally distributed teams Communication and coordination in globally distributed teams Diversity issues in globally distributed teams Customer satisfaction, performance and “trust” building in globally distributed  teams Synchronous and asynchronous decision making in globally distributed teams Comparison of issues across internal, inter-, intra and offshore distributed teams Turbulent economy and its impact on outsourcing Models of globally distributed agile/adaptable teams Knowledge creation, transfer and integration across globally distributed teams Leadership/cohesiveness issues in globally distributed teams Issues related to functional and dysfunctional globally distributed teams Security, privacy and risk associated with globally distributed teams Case Studies (success/failures) related to decision making by globally distributed teams  Call for paper will be listed in several listserves, conferences that mini chairs may attend and by invitation to scholars in the area.

Title of minitrack  •  Human‒Robot Interactions   2.  Research track to which this minitrack belongs  •  Collaboration Systems and Technologies  3.  Description of minitrack (If your proposal is accepted, this minitrack description will be  posted on the conference website and used as a Call for Papers for your minitrack.)  •  Robots are increasingly being adopted in private and public spaces, leading to a  proliferation of human‒robot interactions in the home, workplace, and other public  settings. Robots in the home are performing household chores and acting as home  companions and home health care providers. Robots at work are fulfilling traditional  human roles in logistics, transportation, and manufacturing, serving as both co- workers and supervisors. Robots are also being utilized as tour guides, janitors, and  security officers in public spaces such as museums and airports. Although these  interactions are often collaborative, they are by no means always cooperative.  •  Robot interactions with humans across this array of roles and settings pose interesting  questions  to  scholars  in  various  fields  such  as  information  systems,  robotics,  psychology, and sociology. Interaction with robots is distinct from that with other  artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled technologies in that robots have a physical body that  allows them to manifest physical actions. People cannot only talk to robots but also  touch and be touched by robots. This distinguishes interactions with robots from  interactions with disembodied AI agents, such as voice agents like Siri by Apple and  Alexa by Amazon. Thus, research on human‒robot interaction can differ significantly  from that of human interaction with disembodied AI agents.  •  Given the importance of the topic, we propose an independent minitrack to address  various issues in human‒robot interactions. The minitrack would welcome research  papers  that  explore human‒robot  interaction  and  robot  design  at  any  level  (i.e.  individual, team, organizational, and societal). This minitrack would also cover human‒ robot interaction as much as possible beyond the notion of ""robots as teammates.”  Thus, we would encourage submissions that examine many facets of interactions in  any context (e.g., homes, work, and public services) and role (e.g., companion, co- worker, boss, and adversary).  •  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:  •  Promoting cooperative and collaborative interaction with robots   •  Examining uncooperative and adversarial human interactions with robots  •  The role of adoption and appropriation in human‒robot interactions  •  Empirical studies examining the cognitive, psychological, emotional, and social  aspects of human‒robot interactions  •  The impact of haptic feedback and touch on human‒robot interaction  •  The role of robot attractiveness on human‒robot interaction  •  Ethics on human‒robot interactions   •  Social-emotional models of human‒robot interaction  •  Theoretical frameworks for human‒robot interaction  •  Case studies of human‒robot interaction  •  Design implications for robot interactions at home, work and public spaces  •  Human-oriented practices that promote human‒robot interactions  •  New methodological approaches to studying human‒robot interactions  4.  Marketing plan, i.e. how we would solicit papers  •  AISworld email list every 3‒4 weeks  •  ACM SIGCHI Listservs  •  Research collaboration networks including WAIM (Work in the Age of Intelligent  Machines)  •  Facebook groups (e.g., AIS, ACM, IEEE, and AAAI communities)  •  iSchool Listserv  •  Contacting peer individual scholars whose research involves robots from relevant  fields, such as information systems, industrial engineering, robotics, and human‒ computer interaction (HCI)  5.

MINI-TRACK DESCRIPTION FOR PROGRAM ANNOUNCEMENT  This mini-track discusses the recent phenomenon of human-machine collaboration and  how this next evolution of team composition impacts individual and team dynamics.  Humans and machines are collaborating in new ways and organizations are increasingly  leveraging intelligent system teammates. Decision-makers at all levels of organizations  interact with information systems that are designed to enable better, faster, and more  effective decisions. The problem is that information has reached a critical mass. The sheer  volume of data and data sources make it impossible for a human being to capture and  process all available and relevant data, facts, figures, etc. Therefore, in order to support  effective human decision-making, the need for mixed, human-machine decision-making is  increasing in importance.    Many pseudo-intelligent agents are being incorporated into teams, organizations and daily  life. These varied types of AI use text clues, vocal cues, or other environmental sensors  to retrieve information from the user, process it, and respond appropriately. These agents  help individuals complete everyday tasks such as find directions, ask for help when  ordering goods or services on a website, or understand additional information about a  topic or idea. Humans still use automated agents for simple, utilitarian tasks, but these AI  are undertaking larger and more important tasks. While intelligent agents present a  potential solution, it is not fully understood about how humans will actually interact with  digitized experts or if humans utilize intelligent agents in ways different from traditional  human-to-human  collaboration.  As  intelligent  systems  advance  and  become  more  ubiquitous, we need to explore new dimensions of human-computer collaboration based  on natural communication patterns and consideration of human individual differences.    This mini-track will examine the emergence of this new type of collaboration and its  implications for individuals, teams, and organizations.  It is focused at the intersection of  human-machine  collaboration.  We  seek  papers  that  address  the  social,  technical,  behavioral, attitudinal, emotional, or managerial aspects of intelligent systems in the  workplace. The unit of analysis can be individuals, teams, or organizations. All kinds of  research is welcome including but not limited to quantitative, qualitative, conceptual, or  design-oriented research.      MINI-TRACK COORDINATORS:    Douglas C.

This mini-track discusses the recent advances in human-machine collaboration and how  this next evolution of team composition impacts individual and team dynamics.     Humans and machines are collaborating in new ways and organizations are increasingly  leveraging human-machine teams. Decision-makers at all levels of organizations interact  with information systems that are designed to enable better, faster, and more effective  decisions. The problem is that information has reached a critical mass. The sheer volume  of data and data sources make it impossible for a human being to capture and process all  available and relevant data, facts, figures, etc. Therefore, in order to support effective  human  decision-making,  the  need  for  mixed,  human-machine  decision-making  is  increasing in importance.    Machine  teammates  are  technology-based  systems  that  are  capable  of  sensing,  information processing, decision-making, and learning to act upon their environment and  to interact with humans and other machines in order to achieve a shared task goal with  more or less autonomy. These varied types of AI use text clues, vocal cues, or other  environmental sensors to retrieve information from the user, process it, and respond  appropriately.  These  agents  help  individuals  complete  everyday  tasks  such  as  find  directions, ask for help when ordering goods or services on a website, or understand  additional information about a topic or idea. Humans still use automated agents for simple,  utilitarian tasks, but these AI are undertaking larger and more important tasks. While  intelligent agents present a potential solution, it is not fully understood about how humans  will actually interact with digitized experts or if humans utilize intelligent agents in ways  different from traditional human-to-human collaboration. As intelligent systems advance  and become more ubiquitous, we need to explore new dimensions of human-computer  collaboration based on natural communication patterns and consideration of human  individual differences.    The  papers  will  examine  the  emergence  of  this  new  type  of  collaboration  and  its  implications for individuals, teams, organizations, and crowds.  It is focused at the  intersection of human-machine collaboration.    This mini track provides one of the key international platforms on which the following  issues can be discussed:    1.  Human collaboration with artificial agents and intelligent systems in teams, crowds,  and with individuals    5  2.  Design and evaluation of smart technology as team members including agent- based support (e.g., robots, chatbots) for decision makers  3.  Individual differences that impact collaboration with and acceptance of artificial  intelligence  4.  Usability and design research for human collaboration with automated teammates  5.  Automation and digitalization of collaborative processes   6.  Agent-based support for group facilitation including innovative facilitation methods,  techniques, patterns, and procedures to improve (a)synchronous collaboration  between co-located and distributed people, teams, or groups  7.  Studies and frameworks that examine trust in, satisfaction with, and expectations  of artificial intelligence  8.  Design features for automated teammates that improve human collaboration with  them  9.  Studies of group dynamics when an artificial teammate is on the team  10. Methods and technologies for eliciting and capturing tacit knowledge from experts  (i.e., externalization) and sharing / incorporating that knowledge into collaborative  efforts with automation    There are no preferred methodological stances for this mini-track: this mini-track is open  to both qualitative and quantitative research, to research from a positivist, interpretivist, or  theoretical perspectives, to studies from the lab, from the field, or developmental in nature.     Themes and topics of relevance to this mini-track include, but are not limited to (related  topics not listed are especially welcome):    Human interaction with automated teammates  •  Individual  differences  and  personality  traits  needed  for  quality  collaboration  with  machines  •  Studies that examine leadership, or group dynamics when artificial intelligence is part  of the team  •  Studies or theories that examine trust in automation and how this trust is activated,  violated, increased or diminished by automated teammates  •  Human collaboration with artificial agents and the evaluation of computer systems as  team members, including agent-based support for individual decision makers  •  Case studies or experiments that examine how cultural or organizational paradigms  impact the acceptance or rejection of automated teammates  •  Potential positive impacts (e.g., cognitive support, increased decision accuracy, etc.)  or  negative  (e.g.,  overreliance  on  automation,  loss  of  expertise,  threat,  etc.)  of  introducing automated teammates  •  Potential positive and negative affective impacts (e.g., trust, satisfaction, envy, threat  etc.) of artificial intelligence on individuals     Design approaches for collaborating automatons  •  Theories, guidelines and strategies for designing more collaborative automatons   •  Frameworks for division of labor between human and machine partners   •  Usability considerations as it relates to collaboration with artificial intelligence  •  Affordances of machine-based collaboration agents  •  Architectures for machine-based collaboration agents   •  Proof of concepts – examples of breakthrough collaboration automatons, processes  and systems     6  •  Proof of value – (un)successful filed trials with real users doing real work    Theoretical development for automated teammates  •  Theoretical  foundations  of  trust,  productivity,  creativity,  satisfaction,  and  other  constructs relating to collaboration with artificial intelligence    •  Theories and techniques for incorporating AI into existing teams  •  New phenomena and theories that emerge as humans begin to collaborate with  artificial intelligence   •  Coping  with  resistance  to  change  and  other  challenges  in  machine-based  collaboration  •  Success factors for collaborating with machines  •  Theories for acceptance, use, and diffusion of collaborating automatons  •  Studies on the efficacy of interventions intended to introduce collaborative agents into  an organization        MINI-TRACK COORDINATORS:  Douglas C.

With technology pacing  through maturity stages applications in the field are advancing too. These applications range from  health, education, construction to human resources management and are drawing attention in the  scientific community and the field alike.   Furthermore, use cases are being implemented in service and collaboration applications, sales and  marketing. This broad range of implementations and applications can in turn create value for and  have a broad impact on a company seeking to use mixed reality in a business context.   However, many questions on how this technology impacts businesses, customers and if previous  theories hold true for this new, much more immersive technology is unclear. Therefore, this minitrack  seeks to gain a deeper understanding of mixed reality and shed light on this new technology as well  as its impacts on businesses, customers and to develop new or add to existing theory. Researchers  working on MR in the context of service and collaboration applications, sales and marketing or are  seeking to contribute to testing and advancing MR relevant theory are kindly asked to submit their  contribution to this mini track.   Although this track is not focussing on advancing technical solutions contributions that help businesses  use the technology (reference framework or technology navigator) are eligible for consideration and  publication in this track too.

Individuals seek out  information online for both utilitarian and hedonic reasons. Online forums are one example of a pervasive  platform where individuals can submit and receive answers to questions as well as browse the  experiences of others. Individuals with questions often turn to these forums, either directly or indirectly  (through search engine results), to find answers to problems they face. While research has begun to  address utilitarian and hedonic seeking and consumption of information, there is still much left unknown.  This mini-track focuses on research related to understanding information processing and decision making  in the context of online communities. The following is a list of sample topics (non-exhaustive) that would  be a good fit for this mini-track:  •  How individuals search for, filter, or adopt online information  •  Online decision-making processes  •  Cognitive processing related to consumption of online information  •  Validation of online content  •  Community based cues  •  Evaluation of different cue types (e.g., upvotes, star ratings)  •  Design elements of tools to support online communities  •  Crowdsourced knowledge  •  Approaches to increase contributions/engagement  •  Novel approaches to support online communities    Journals - Fast Track  None currently.   Marketing Plan  Over the last decade we have conducted research on the mini-track topic and want to continue to bring  together like-minded researchers to formalize the conversation around these topics. We are running a  similar mini-track at AMCIS 2020, HICSS 2021, and AMCIS 2021. We plan to recruit those that submit  and review for the mini-track. We will make specific invitations to researchers that are already publishing  in this area (we have started a list) and of course advertise more broadly on traditional channels.

However, with the advent of information  technology, and the internet, the expectations for conducting, publishing, and  communicating research has changed drastically, where scientists are no longer  restricted by this traditional scientific process. Instead, scientists have started to  adopt more open approaches to their research projects, which has seen open  science (OS) growing in prominence in recent years, and is challenging this  traditional scientific process used in information systems (IS) research. OS refers to  making scientific knowledge freely available to the public, where open practices are  becoming a requirement to be eligible for funding from most competitive funding  schemes.    OS consists of different concepts such as open access (making published research  articles freely  available  under  an  open  access  licence); open data (requiring  researchers to make research data publicly available with their submitted papers);  open methodology (sharing methodological details, such as data collection and  analysis processes); open artefact(s) (making artefacts accessible online for free,  with an open license to use,modify and reuse); and open peer review (where  researchers and reviewers know each others identities). The impact of OS can be  seen through the use of registered reports (RR), which facilitate a form of peer  review that breaks studies into two stages: (i) study pre-registration - authors identify  a relevant problem and detail their research design, which is submitted for (open)  peer review and feedback, (ii) improved research execution - the study is completed  with the improved design.    The objective of this minitrack is to give researchers the opportunity to present novel  and innovative ways that they are conducting research using OS concepts outlined  above. In doing so we aim to push the boundary of how IS research is conducted  and communicated to the community. Indeed, OS should be more transparent, with  greater potential to verify, replicate, and freely share the results. Such openness  should also provide a platform for creating research that demonstrates proof-of-use  as the community strives to become more relevant to practice. We therefore suggest  that the community should strongly engage with OS, and in order to do so, we are  looking for both conceptual and empirical papers that either further our  understanding of OS in IS research, or studies that practice it.     Thus, we invite papers that focus on (but is not limited to) any of the following topics  around open science in IS research:    ● Philosophical considerations  ● Ethical implications   ● Methodological considerations  ● Policies of open science  ● Papers that practice one (or more) concepts of open science in their study  ● Registered reports in IS research (can be either stage 1 or stage 2)  ● Understanding of different platforms/tools/technologies for practicing open  science  ● Success/Failure cases that have arisen while practicing open science  ● How we can improve or innovate open science practices  ● Benefits of practicing open science  ● Challenges and/or problems with practicing open science  Marketing Plan  To attract submissions to the minitrack we'll disseminate the call and description  through a number of methods including:  ● Posting to the AISWorld and Wirtschaftsinformatik mailing lists  ​ ​ ● Posting (with permission) in open science networks such as ANZORN, Open  Science (@_open_science_), and the ACM Emerging Interest Group on  ​ ​ Reproducibility and Independent Verification  ● Posting to our own social media connections, along with the use of relevant  tags such as #openscienceinis, #openscience, and #registeredreports   ● We will also use the networks of our colleagues, requesting if they would  promote the post in their own networks  Journals for fast track opportunities  N/A  Minitrack Chair  Name: Dr. Cathal Doyle   ​ Affiliation: Victoria University of Wellington  ​ Contact information: cathal.doyle@vuw.ac.nz   ​ ​ Bio: Cathal is a lecturer in information systems at the School of Information  ​ Management at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand.

An understanding of social and psychological aspects of  collaboration is essential to creating productive work environments. The use of collaboration and  communication systems and the consequences of such use are framed by the psychological and  social factors concerning the users and their work environment. It is important to understand  these  factors  to  successfully  facilitate  the  sustained  implementation  and  use  of  these  technologies. Further, knowledge of the psychological, social, behavioral, and cognitive aspects  of technology-supported collaboration and communication also assists in detecting, avoiding,  and effectively resolving the issues that may arise from using such technologies.     This proposed minitrack is especially timely in the context of the increased use of AI, social media,  remote work arrangements, and collaboration technologies by organizations and individuals.  Specifically, social media offer various ways to connect, collaborate, form communities and  dynamic crowds, and share information and knowledge. AI offer new opportunities to engage  customers,  support  organizational  decision-making,  and  become  part  of  teams.  As  many  organizations  are  figuring  out  productive  ways  to  create  value  from  such  technologies,  researchers have intensified efforts to understand and design ways in which new collaboration  technologies can support both work- and pleasure-related activities. Such research often involves  or requires psycho-social, behavioral, and cognitive perspectives.     SHORT MINITRACK DESCRIPTION  This minitrack focuses on the social, psychological, behavioral, and cognitive factors that can  affect the design, development, use, and application of collaboration tools and technologies. We  seek papers that address the social and psychological perspectives, concepts, and theories of  collaboration and communication technologies, including AI, social media applications, and  remote work technologies. Of particular interest are papers that study an IS phenomenon with  Sociology/Psychology/Cognition  as  a  referent  discipline  as  well  as  papers  that  study  a  Sociology/Psychology/Behavioral/Cognition  phenomenon  situated  in  an  IS  domain  or  application.     Specifically,  the  “Social  &  Psychological  Perspectives  in  Collaboration  Research”  minitrack  focuses on, but is not limited to:  1.  Personality,  behavioral,  cognitive,  and  social  factors  related  to  communication  and  collaboration in co-located and distributed groups and crowds  2.  Social and psychological effects of collaboration technologies and AI  3.  Creativity techniques and tools in collaborative settings  4.  Attractions  and  affiliations  in  groups  and  crowds  arising  from  use  of  collaboration  technologies  5.  Team/group/crowd psychology and the use of collaboration technologies and AI  6.  Effects and consequences of personality and other personal traits on system design and use  7.  Psycho-social  and  cognitive  factors  influencing  acceptance  and  implementation  of  collaboration technologies and AI  8.  Leadership issues involved in collaboration  9.  Malevolent behaviors in online collaboration  10. Unintended  organizational  and  team  consequences  of  AI,  social  media,  and  other  collaboration technologies    MINITRACK SCOPE  The scope of this minitrack concerns the various social, psychological, behavioral, and cognitive  issues that surround the design, deployment, and use of AI, social media, and other collaboration  technologies.  This  minitrack  will  host  research  papers  and  presentations  that  provide  a  social/psychological perspective on studying issues related to the dynamic interplay between  people, their environment, and the technologies they use to create collaborative value. Examples  of relevant areas and theories in psychology that fit within this minitrack’s scope include, but are  not limited to:  •  Personality   •  Cultural psychology   •  Social psychology  •  Cognitive psychology  •  Creativity   •  Diversity  •  Leadership  •  Prejudice and discrimination  •  Attitudes and social intelligence  •  Social learning theory  •  Self efficacy  •  Behavioral theories  •  Violence and aggression  •  Attractions and affiliations in groups   •  Group psychology     A minitrack on psycho-social perspectives will be appealing and inclusive for many researchers  who do not operate in the core of the (M)IS discipline yet conduct research with AI, social media,  and online technologies, for example researchers in media and arts, human factors, social  psychology, informatics, innovation, communication, information science, etc. In other words,  this minitrack will attract two types of contributors: (a) IS researchers and researchers in related  disciplines who are using psychology as referent discipline, and (b) psychology researchers who  are using IS/IT as an application domain. This will help HICSS expand its horizon and attract a  larger  audience  to  include,  for  example  Industrial/Organizational  psychologists,  learning/behavioral researchers, Management researchers and many others.    PREVIOUS MINITRACKS   This topic was first part of the 2012 HICSS-45 conference. This minitrack was highly successful,  attracting 16 submissions and attendants at the conference. The conference attracted attendees  from business schools, IS researchers with psychological focus, and management researchers.  Papers related to personality theories, motivation, addiction, trust, and web psychologies were  presented.  The success of minitrack has continued over HICSS-46-54 conferences. At HICSS-46 a  paper from this minitrack was honored as the best paper in the Collaboration Systems and  Technologies Track. This honor was repeated at HICSS-54, when once again a paper from this  minitrack received the best paper award for the Collaboration Systems and Technologies Track.

MINITRACK DESCRIPTION FOR PROGRAM ANNOUNCEMENT (150 Words)  This minitrack seeks papers that address social, psychological, behavioral, and cognitive  perspectives, concepts, and theories of collaboration, communication, social media and AI  technologies. Papers which have IS as a core issue and Psychology/Sociology as a referent  discipline as well as papers which focus on a Psychology/Sociology phenomenon with IS  applications are invited. This minitrack focuses on the workings of the social, psychological,  behavioral, and cognitive factors that can affect the design, development, use, and application  of collaboration, AI, and social media technologies.               APPENDIX – CONCEPT CALL FOR PAPERS    HICSS-55Call for papers for the minitrack on:  “SOCIAL & PSYCHOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES   IN COLLABORATION RESEARCH”  Part of the Collaboration Systems and Technology Track  of the Fifty Fifth Annual  Hawai'i International Conference on Systems Sciences (HICSS)  January 4-7, 2022, Maui, Hawaii, USA    Papers are invited for the minitrack on ""Social & Psychological Perspectives in Collaboration  Research"" as part of the Collaboration Systems and Technology Track at the Hawaii International  Conference on System Sciences (HICSS).     One of the major assets of any organization is its people. Understanding of the people and their  social, psychological, cultural, and emotional environment helps organizations develop systems  and processes that can lead to a productive workplace. Changes in technology, globalization, and  increased competition have all created an environment in which an understanding of people is  the critical link that is needed in order to survive and thrive in today’s competitive environment.     Technology supported collaboration and communication between individuals entails complex  social and psychological situations. An understanding of social and psychological aspects of  collaboration is essential to creating and sustaining productive work environments. The use of  collaboration technologies, AI, and social media and the consequences of such use are framed by  the psychological and social factors concerning the users and their work environment. It is  important to understand these factors to successfully facilitate the sustained implementation  and use of these technologies. Further, knowledge of the psycho-social aspects of technology- supported collaboration and communication also assists in detecting, avoiding, and effectively  resolving the issues that may arise from using such technologies. Thus, it is essential to study the  psycho-social issues surrounding the design and usage of these technologies.    Modern collaboration technologies, including but not limited to AI, Social Media, VR, and Web  2.0, offer various ways to connect, collaborate, make decisions, form communities, and share  information and knowledge. As many organizations are figuring out productive ways to create  value from collaborative, technology-supported networks, researchers have intensified efforts to  understand and design ways in which communication technologies can support both work- related and pleasure related activities. Such research often involves or requires psycho-social  perspectives.     Thus, this minitrack provides one of the key international platforms to host research papers and  presentations that provide a social/psychological perspective on studying issues related to the  dynamic  interplay  between  people,  their  environment,  and  the  collaboration  and  social  technologies they use. Some examples of research areas within the scope of this minitrack  include, but are not limited to:    •  Personality, behavioral, cognitive, and social factors related to communication and  collaboration in co-located and distributed groups and crowds  •  Social and psychological effects of collaboration technologies and AI  •  Creativity techniques and tools in collaborative settings  •  Attractions and affiliations in groups and crowds arising from use of collaboration  technologies  •  Team/group/crowd psychology and use of collaboration technologies and AI  •  Effects and consequences of personality and other personal traits on system design and use  •  Psycho-social and cognitive factors influencing acceptance and implementation of  collaboration technologies and AI  •  Leadership issues involved in collaboration  •  Malevolent behaviors in online collaboration  •  Unintended organizational and team consequences of AI, social media, and other  collaboration technologies    However, the above examples do not provide a comprehensive overview. We invite any paper  that contains original research highlighting the human component in collaboration and social  technologies. There are no preferred methodological stances for this minitrack: this minitrack is  open to both qualitative and quantitative research, to research from a positivist, interpretivist,  or critical perspective, to studies from the lab, from the field, design-oriented or developmental  in nature.

With greater connectivity brought about by the  proliferation of internetworking technologies, it has become much easier for individuals to circumvent  spatial and temporal barriers during interactions, thereby giving rise to a novel Sharing Economy that is  structured around the disintermediation of conventional channels of commerce in the exchange of both  tangible and intangible resources. The sharing economy has gained notable attention within mainstream  media as a new economic paradigm that leverages peer-to-peer technological platforms to facilitate  exchange of resources among individuals who are joined via fluid relational networks. Almost overnight,  numerous peer-to-peer platforms—in the likes of crowd-working (e.g., Airbnb, Uber, Amazon Mechanic  Turk, E-Lance, Fiverr), co-innovation (e.g., Mindmixer, Social Innovator), crowd-funding (e.g., Kickstarter,  Indiegogo), crowd-searching (e.g., Crowdfynd, CrowdSearching), and crowd-voting (e.g., California Report  Card, Threadless) — have sprung up to facilitate both individuals and/or organizations to pool resources  in resolving problems.  While there are many practitioners who have prophesized the sharing economy as a game-changer for  how organizations and society function, there are also a number of detractors who questioned the  uncertain and potentially disruptive future that is brought about by such peer-to-peer exchanges. Critics  have painted a dismal picture of the sharing economy as a means for individuals and/or firms to dodge  proper regulations and live beyond their means, which in turn contributes to doomsday scenarios of  massive job displacements and spending habits detrimental to society. In light of the opportunities and  challenges posed by the sharing economy, there is a clear urgency for a systematic and thorough scrutiny  of how value creation and appropriation can take place within such economic environments while  minimizing its negative impact to society.  The aim of this mini-track is to sensitize both academics and practitioners to the latest trends and  developments in the sharing economy in order to determine how value can be created and appropriated  within this novel economic environment powered primarily by technology. This mini-track embraces both  retrospective and progressive views of how the sharing economy has evolved and would transform with  technological advances. We welcome papers that identify and address knowledge gaps in how emergent  technologies are shaping the access and sharing of resources within online peer-to-peer communities.  Papers that subscribe to inter-disciplinary perspectives and/or adopt mixed methods are particularly  welcome.  Topics of interest of the mini-track include, but are not limited to:    Collaborative consumption and production in sharing economy    Crowdfunding and communal investment    Crowdsourcing and open innovation    Crowd platform strategies    Data privacy and security in sharing economy    Design and innovation of crowd platforms    Effect of the Covid-19 on sharing economy activities    Digital business models of sharing economy    Digital labor markets and workforce management in sharing economy    Disruptive innovation in sharing economy    Market mechanics of sharing economy    Policy formulation for sharing economy    Reputation and trust in sharing economy    Social network in sharing economy    Socio-economic and political challenges of sharing economy    Value appropriation in sharing economy  Best papers accepted to this mini-track will be fast-tracked to Internet Research, an international and  refereed journal that is indexed and abstracted in major databases (e.g., SSCI, SCI, ABI/INFORM Global).    Short Biographies of Mini-Track Chair:    Bo Sophia Xiao is an Associate Professor in the Information Technology Management Department at the  Shidler College of Business, University of Hawai’i at Mānoa.

"HICSS-54","CL","Collaboration Systems and Technologies","5b58ba05-23da-4a02-8d3a-8269cae7b967","Text Analytics","	 HICSS 55 – Minitrack Proposal    Text Analytics     Track:     Collaboration Systems and Technologies     Minitrack Title:  Text Analytics    Building on the success of the “Text Mining in Big Data Analytics” minitrack at HICSS- 49-54, we are pleased to submit this updated proposal to continue the Text Analytics  minitrack at HICSS-55. The Text Analytics minitrack is also built on the successful  HICSS tutorials on Text Mining we have organized since HICSS-48.  At HICSS-51, we  had over 90 registered participants for the text mining tutorial, including 19 doctoral  students.  We  had  75  registered  participants  for  HICSS-52,  with  very  good  participation throughout the entire tutorial. For HICSS-53, we had 45 registered  participants, with close to 50 participating throughout the entire tutorial. At HICSS- 52, even though our minitrack session was in the last slot on the last day, we had a  great turnout and four excellent papers, which were well received by the participants.   For HICSS-53, we built on the integration between the text mining tutorial and the  minitrack and had more submissions and greater participation in our two sessions.  At  the  virtual  HICSS-54,  we  had  a  very  successful  virtual  minitrack,  with  19  participants, and three excellent papers presented.   For HICSS-55 we will continue to build on these strategies to further strengthen  our minitrack on text analytics. This minitrack recognizes the reality that global  collaboration systems, social media, and information systems of all types, generate  enormous  amounts  of  unstructured  textual  data,  including:  system  logs,  email  archives,  websites,  blog  posts,  meeting  transcripts,  speeches,  annual  reports,  published material, and social media posts.  While this unstructured textual data is  readily available, it presents tremendous challenges to researchers trying to analyze  these large bodies of text with traditional methods. Text analytics is an increasingly  important  technique  for  an  interdisciplinary  group  of  scholars,  practitioners,  government officials, and international organizations.  For example, the data science  community Kaggle provides some excellent text datasets and ongoing competitions  (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). Also, the number of text analytics courses being  taught at the graduate and undergraduate levels continues to expand. We have also  explored  a  fast  track  to  journal  publishing  opportunities  for  our  text  analytics  minitrack with the peer-reviewed, open access journal Data & Policy. We believe this  will yield a collaboration (https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/data-and-policy).     The  Minitrack  on  Text  Analytics  is  designed  to  provide  a  highly  engaging  interactive forum and community for researchers and practitioners to discuss the  critical issues of related to text analytics and contribute to the big data focus at HICSS.   	 	 The HICSS-55 Minitrack on Text Analytics invites papers that apply text-mining  approaches to a wide variety of substantive domains, including, but not limited to,  theoretical and applied approaches to analyzing various genres of textual data:  •  Blog posts  •  Twitter and social media  •  Email archives  •  Published articles  •  Websites  •  Meeting and call center transcripts  •  Speeches  •  Online discussion forums  •  Online communities  •  Computer logs  •  Incident and maintenance reports  •  Patents  •  Contracts  •  Legal Documents  •  Public policies and public comments  •  News transcripts  •  Published articles  •  Customer feedback  •  Resumes and CVs  •  Employee evaluations  •  Insurance claims  •  Annual reports    And addressing methodological challenges, such as:  •  Automated acquisition and cleaning data  •  Working on distributed, high-performance computers  •  Overcoming API limitations  •  Using LDA, LSA, and other techniques  •  Robust Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques  •  Text summarization, classification, and clustering.    Minitrack Relevance:    The analysis of various forms of text is increasingly important at HICSS, which was  ahead of many other international professional and academic conferences in including  this area. For example, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)  organized the 2020 Text Analysis Conference in 2020. In addition, the 2021 Text  Analytics  Forum  will  be  held  in  Washington,  DC  form  17-18  November  2021  (https://www.text-analytics-forum.com/2020/default.aspx).  	 	 In 2014, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) launched  a new competition on Big Data and Analytics within its highly competitive senior  executive branch fellowship program.  The review panel for this prestigious fellowship  was chaired by the chair of the HICSS Text Analytics minitrack Dr. Derrick L. Cogburn.  In 2014, The Big Boulder Initiative was formed. It is a trade association wholly  dedicated to “the advancement of social data in businesses and organizations of all  kinds.” http://bigboulderinitiative.org  A 2013 IEEE Conference on Big Data Analytics  from  6-9  October  2013  in  Santa  Clara,  CA:  http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2013/, highlighted original research on the 5Vs  of Big Data (Volume, Velocity, Variety, Value and Veracity).  The Big Data Innovation  Summit,  highlighted  for  participants  the  value  of  customer  data:  https://theinnovationenterprise.com/summits/big-data-innovation-boston.    Finally,  the 11th Annual Text and Social Analytics from 5-6 June 2013 in Boston, MA helped  reinforce  the  importance  of  text  analyst  to  insights  gained  from  big  data.  http://www.textanalyticsnews.com/text-mining-conference/conference-agenda.php.  Dr. Cogburn teaches a graduate seminar on this subject at American University.   Unfortunately, text analytics still receives far too little attention, and this minitrack  addresses that oversight.    This minitrack benefits from close cooperation with the Provalis Research Corporation.    Marketing Plan:    We plan to market the minitrack as follows:  •  Contact by email everyone that participated in our HICSS text mining tutorials  from 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54 and the other tutorials and workshops at  HICSS-53 and invite them to submit a paper for HICSS-55.  •  Encourage them to forward the email to potentially interested colleagues.  •  Contact anyone who submitted a paper to HICSS related to text mining and  encourage them to submit to this minitrack.  •  Contact participants at other workshops and tutorials on text mining conducted  by the minitrack chairs, inviting them to submit a paper.  •  Contact companies offering software for text mining encouraging them to  identify potential paper authors.  •  Encourage  our  colleagues  at  AAAS  and  other  professional  and  academic  associations where text mining research and practice is being conducted and  encourage them to help promote the minitrack.  •  Contact personal acquaintances working in academia and elsewhere and ask  them to submit a paper and to spread the word.  •  Advertise through traditional academic channels such as AISWorld listserv.  •  Publish the call for papers by submitting it -- insofar as this is possible -- to  the same lists as calls for papers for other, similar conferences.

In academia and industry, extensive discussions on biased data sets and algorithms have started and thus we should talk extensively about our journeys to achieve fairness, non-biased, risk-averse and trustworthy AI.  We would be interested in learning how to synchronise technology advances, principles and practices of Data Science, abundance of data processed through AI, and automatic generation of algorithmic predictions through various software tools.  Whether we are waiting for a new way of looking at the problem of transparency of AI or creating a new computational paradigm, which would automatically detect hidden dangers in data sets and associated algorithms, we need to engage in wider talks across communities which have impact on or are affected by the current status of AI. We invite a spectrum of papers, which highlight any of our concerns and the topics below, and thus help us to cut through the current hype of AI.  Discussions at the HICSS conference would answer many AI questions we may have and show a vision where the world of algorithmic computing in AI might be heading.  We are particularly interested in the impact the Data Scienc At the time of writing this proposal, we could not find a conference, which comprehensively addresses the AI accountability e has had on the way we create algorithmic computations, and thus would like to debate if Data Science practices might be contributing towards creating more obscurity of AI algorithms. The co-relation between Data Science and AI algorithms is obvious, but we still look at the two of them separately without evaluating the impact they may have on each other. We would also welcome the applications of these novel research results in cyber physical spaces, pervasive and intelligent healthcare, medicine, robotics, smart cities and autonomous transport, automation, IoT and many more.   Indicative Topics are: Evaluation of AI Algorithms Multidisciplinary nature of AI evaluations Methods of evaluating and explaining AI algorithms and their complexities  Computational paradigm and frameworks for evaluating ML and AI Algorithms Reconstructing AI algorithms from their descriptions and explanations Automatic creation of transparent AI models and algorithms Software testing and AI: Testing AI and its algorithms using software testing principles and methods Adaptation of software testing to specificity of AI-based software solutions Interpretability of algorithms through models and criteria for decision making  The pace of AI innovation and responses of society Social and legal outcome of fair algorithms Ethics, legal and socio-technical issues in AI based systems Ethical issues and sharing principles in designing AI algorithms AI monitoring and regulations AI Algorithmic harm: dishonesty, fairness and lack of awareness in AI The risk of NOT using AI  Obscurity of AI Algorithms Impenetrable obscurity of AI AI evaluation and seeing “what is inside the black box” Black-box functions in AI and decision making Human control in AI based systems versus black box algorithms versus transparency in AI Trade-off between algorithmic decision making in and transparency of AI-based systems AI accountability regime and the level of human trusts built by algorithms Accountability versus responsibility in AI based systems Performance of transparent AI models and algorithms  AI Algorithms, Fairness and Data Science Identifying BIAS which matters BIASED AI and automatic decision making BIASED semantic representation of data and human BIAS Abstractions in machine learning algorithms and fairness Impact of Data Science practices on semantic of data in training/learning algorithms Co-relation between Data Science and AI computational models Discovering fairness in AI algorithms through the semantic of data Impact of statistical methods on Data Science and on the evaluation/transparency/explanations of AI ______________________________________________     The co-hairs’ employers endorse their involvement and will pay for our travel and registration cost to attend HICSS.  In this year, we left the proposal similar to the last year, except for removing word “explainable AI” to avoid overlapping with a different Minitrack.  We also updated the main text and a few bullet points.  We hope that we will be able to do what we planned last year, but were distracted due to the pandemic.  We will search for papers through our contacts and research collaborations in EU/Norway/UK and US.  We still have ACM FAT events as our competitors, but ACM FAccT Community moved to March 2021 and no conference is announced for early 2022.  ACM FAccT do not focus too much on evaluation of algorithmic computing behind the AI and they do not talk about potential impact the Data Science may have on AI.

Big data sources have scaled beyond the capacities and capabilities of commercial database management systems. Structured representations become a bottleneck to efficient data storage and retrieval for unstructured and more complex data. Kaisler, Armour, Money and Espinosa (2013) have noted five major challenges associated with big data (the five Vs): increasing volume of data, increasing velocity (e.g., in/out and change of data), increasing variety of data types and structures, determining the veracity of data, and understanding the value that big data brings to the decision-making process.   Over the past 10 years, an increasing number of disciplines and problem domains have been identified where big data is having an impact. Each year one sees an increase in the number of challenges and opportunities for big data to have a major impact on business, social and physical sciences. Besides the technical challenges of managing and utilizing big data effectively, there are several business and organizational challenges that come with the use of big data, such as: data governance and curation, information security, privacy, big data strategy, management of human resources, the business value of big data investments, ethical considerations, and coordination of big data initiatives, among other things.  Big Data Analytics is continuing to mature as a discipline, but one in need of distinguishing methodologies and tools and effective business approaches. The challenges and opportunities have multiplied over the past several years and continue to grow. As the plethora of data grows, new methods are required to gather, manage, process and understand the data in order to provide actionable information for decision-makers, matching the domain knowledge and problems with specific missions and constraints. We are seeing competing approaches in research, emphasizing explainable (i.e., interpretable) models pitted against black-box, uninterpretable but highly accurate models. More research is needed to understand the business value of the benefits and shortcomings of various approaches within this continuum.  The emergence of streaming analytics with (near) real-time data processing has motivated significant attention to storage and processing performance. New metrics are required to assess its impact on decision-making in each domain where success is defined in mission-based terms. Assessing the value generated through analytics within decision-making processes is an open research problem because it (often) requires maintaining the provenance of data as its progresses through an analytical framework.  Data Science/Analytic Science Big Data has contributed to the field of Data Science, which is an analytics-based discipline that generates new data representations from existing data through transformation, translation, integration, and data mining – among other techniques. Data science and business analytics are largely grounded on statistics, data engineering, data mining, decision analysis and descriptive and predictive modeling.  Data science has matured rapidly, and many techniques and methods are now familiar to data scientists.  We are also beginning to see more research on approaches that use a blend of various methods, rather than single ones. For example, natural language processing and text mining are often used to develop actor or entity relationships in the text, which are then analyzed using graph theory and network analytics. Similarly, we are seeing more visual analytics complementing quantitative analytics, which is becoming a prevalent approach on social media and social network analytics. It is our belief that new computational methods using a variety of analytic tools and methods, other than statistics will become increasingly more important.  We term this approach Analytic Science. The analytic scientist will be not just the statistician, number cruncher and data visualizer – as many bloggers have put it – but will evolve to be a renaissance system scientist who will possess a wide variety of skills and knowledge suitable to exploring big data, grounded in domain knowledge and have expertise that informs both predictive and prescriptive analytics.  Numerous universities have created new degree programs and research centers in Data Science and Business and Data Analytics. Our host institutions – American University and George Washington University – are among these. Our co-chairs, J. Alberto Espinosa and Frank Armour at American University, devised a body of knowledge framework as a basis for grounding Big Data and Business Analytics curricula. J. Alberto Espinosa architected and designed the curriculum and lead the implementation of two M.S. Analytics programs (campus and online). He also teaches business process analysis, predictive analytics and graph and network analytics.  Frank Armour is presently the Director of American University’s Business Analytics program. Frank Armour teaches database, big data, business analytics and text analytics.   Alberto Espinosa is the architect for the MS Analytics programs and undergraduate specialization on business analytics at American University’s Kogod School of Business.   Steve Kaisler has been teaching Big Data and Analytics at George Washington University’s Computer Science Department for the past eight years. He helped to create a new MS in Data Analytics program at George Washington University.  The co-chairs along with William Money of The Citadel have co-authored a two volume book on Obtaining Value from Big Data for Service Systems, published by Business Expert Press.  Paper submissions on the structure and evaluation of curriculum design, implementation and evaluation for big data and analytics are welcome.  Big Data and Analytics: Organizational Issues As a recent Bloomberg BusinessWeek survey of 930 businesses pointed out, business analytics is a field in an “emerging state”. While we grapple with the technical issues associated with big data and analytics, the associated organizational and business issues are beginning to mount into substantial piles. Research in information systems has seen significant intellectual contributions over the last 30 years in areas like: the business value of IT; modeling IS success human-computer interaction; technology adoption; and coordination in technology work; just to name a few. This emerging field has re-energized IS and IT research and brought its visibility to new levels, but there is little research in any of the business and organizational aspects of big data and analytics. This represents a deep knowledge gap in the research literature.   Consequently, we propose this mini track to solicit paper submissions that: advance our knowledge of Big Data storage and structure; help us learn about effective processes and approaches to effectively manage Big Data and the associated business analytics; begin to identify ways to measure the organizational benefits derived from using and analyzing Big Data; present case studies of Big Data implementation and use; address the design and development of analytical frameworks that incorporate multiple analytic methods and techniques based on different architectures and technologies; and address the organizational and business aspects of big data and analytics. Papers will be solicited in several areas, including, but not limited to the following:   Challenges in managing big data repositories and projects – exabytes and beyond. Analytics Enterprise Governance:  Including data standardization, privacy and security  Graph analytics – both syntactic and semantic – that play a big role in the exploitation of social media data. Advanced analytics, – emphasizing visual analytics and non-numeric analysis models and their implementation as applied to complex problems in different domains. Scalable semantic annotation and reasoning across big data stores. Metrics for assessing the impact of big data in business, scientific, and governmental decision-making. Evaluation, analysis and comparison of explainable vs. black-box models. Organizational and business aspects of big data, analytics and data science. Educational and body of knowledge frameworks on big data, analytics, data science and analytic science. Analytics for large-scale, fast and unstructured changes in very large data sets – petabytes and beyond. The changing nature of analytics from precise modeling to fast, adaptive computational intelligence for handling imprecise knowledge. Big data and analytics as enabling technologies for a smart society – smart cities, aging populations, and responses to critical environmental and geopolitical problems. New analytics as the basis for cognitive computing and connected (possibly distributed) intelligence that augments human decision-making.  Challenges in managing big data repositories The primary representation schemes for big data have revolved around the use of NoSQL database systems and RDF, RDFS, and associated specifications. A critical question is whether NoSQL databases can scale to the exabyte range or beyond. Scaling of existing data repositories (relational DBMS, RDF flat files, HDFS, data lakes, etc.) beyond the exabyte range is an open research problem. A few data sets of exabyte size exist in distributed systems, but it is difficult to evaluate practically or theoretically whether such systems will scale.  Research into the performance of distributed NoSQL databases and new repository structures is urgently required as exabyte data sets have become the new benchmark for very large data sets and zettabyte databases are emerging for many governmental and scientific applications.  New representation schemes for unstructured data, particularly large volumes of text, audio and video files, are of especial interest. Research is required in real-time analytics infused with domain knowledge. New algorithms for real-time stream processing of large volumes of data at terabit and petabit speeds need to be developed and new data structures and storage systems created to accept and organize such data.  Graph analytics – both syntactic and semantic As RDF/RDFS describes a graph through linked data, numerous analytics based on mathematical graph theory have been designed and applied to big data. These syntactic algorithms along with statistical approaches have been the basis for much of data science. Research is required in advanced algorithms based on domain knowledge and model-driven approaches to analyzing linked data graphs that scale no worse than O(n2). As graphs and networks become richer in their descriptive power and multiple edges connect nodes within the graph (meshes), algorithms become more complex as more possible paths through the mesh emerge. New mechanisms for annotating nodes and edges which become complex data structures in their own right are required. New algorithms which are parallelizable in order to ensure timely execution are also required. New methods are required for visualizing complex multidimensional graphs and meshes representing data on the petabyte and exabyte scale.  Advanced Analytics Big data has been processed using parallel systems – both hardware and software. MPI and MapReduce are two systems that have been used to develop analytics. Scala and Python, as well as other programming languages, are beginning to replace MapReduce as the implementing system for Big Data because of their interactive capabilities.  Research is required into other types of analytic frameworks suitable for large-scale (e.g., thousands to millions of processors) parallel processing. Advanced analytics seek to derive meaningful information from very large complex data sets. We have characterized the extremes as “finding the needle in the haystack” and “turning straw into gold”. Papers describing analytics applied to any large data volume representation are sought, particularly those that can provide a competitive advantage through business intelligence. Papers are also sought in multi-format data analytics and visual analytics. While analytic algorithms can reduce big data to actionable information, the resulting data may still be very large. Research into innovative techniques for data and information visualization, including 3D and other sensory modalities, is required to assist decision-makers in quickly grasping the importance of processed data within specific domains.  Qualitative versus Quantitative Analytics Much of the Big Data analysis reported over the past few years has used quantitative methods to analyze data. However, researchers are realizing that quantitative methods tend to obscure some of the underlying information that would answer the question “why?”. There is an emerging interest in using qualitative analytics to process big data concurrently with quantitative methods. Papers focused on the description and application of qualitative methods to Big Data are solicited.  Metrics for assessing the impact of big data The contribution of big data to decision making requires new metrics for assessing the five Vs mentioned above, particularly the value proposition. Few such metrics exist today. Research into metrics will require domain knowledge and, include sizing and incremental changes to decisions based on streaming data, and identifying tipping points in decisions and the effect of uncertainty in large masses of data. In addition, an understanding of the methods used to submit the results of big data analysis to decision makers, time frames required, and types of decisions incorporating big data findings are appropriate for submission.  Edge Analytics to Facilitate Real-time Processing of Streaming Data As streaming data speeds increase, we may not be able to store the data fast enough or it may be so perishable that it is no longer worth processing if we have to store it first, then process it. Edge Analytics moves the information processing mechanisms to the location where the data is collected; makes perishability decisions; processes data as it is collected; and determines what needs to be forward to storage mechanisms and what can be discarded. It provides (near) real-time processing of data through multiple analytics to facilitate (near) real-time decision-making. High performance algorithms running on high performance platforms are required to deliver the required performance.  Big Data and Analytics: Issues and Challenges We published a paper titled “Big Data Redux: Issues and Challenges” in the HICSS-52 Proceedings, which reviewed the state of Big Data since our first paper was published in 2013 (which now has over 1000 citations). We found that several areas dominated the research in areas mentioned in our paper, while some areas were neglected. We highlight these neglected areas in order to seek papers to advance the Big Data and Analytics field: data storage and transport, analytic complexity, privacy, security, governance, compliance, and data ownership, system and software architecture. Little has been written about the analytical challenges of developing sound prescriptive models that can leverage the potential of BDA. We also note that spatial analytics and visualization analytics are receiving greater attention as new applications for emerge that support decision-making in complex domains.  Relation to other Big Data and Business Analytics Minitracks: There were 22 or more mini tracks across HICSS-54 that mentioned “big data” and “analytics” in their titles. Within the Decision Analytics track, there were 8 such mini tracks, some of which were hard to differentiate. Perhaps the closest analog is the “Business Analytics/Business Intelligence …” minitrack in “Organizational Systems and Technology”, but it seems to be more focused on theory building and design research rather than the analytics themselves. The Program Chair and the Track Chairs have determined to reduce the overlap among minitracks to provide clearly identifiable and focused forums for researchers to submit their papers. We support this effort and have adjusted our minitrack proposal accordingly based on discussion with the Decision Analytics track co-chairs. However, the proliferation of “Big Data” and “Analytics” minitracks across HICSS may be diluting the impact of this theme. Some consolidation of minitrack topics related to Big Data and Analytics is recommended.  At HICSS-53, the minitrack co-chairs offered two half-day tutorials: Introduction to Big Data Governance and Forensic Analysis of Failed Software Projects. Both tutorials had significant pre-registration for the conference, and had the attendance of over 30 people at the conference, the majority of them walk-ins rather than pre-registrants. Each session – two for each tutorial had several participants attending. The DA Big Data minitrack sessions at HICSS-54 had over 25 attendees in its virtual session hosted on Zoom.  HICSS represents a major venue for presenting current research, practice, and case studies on big data and semantic reasoning. We continue to evolve our understanding of Big Data and Analytics in order to attract high-quality papers in innovative technologies, methods, practices, and applications.   Two special issues of the journal International Journal of Systems and Service-Oriented Engineering (IJSSOE), published by IGI, featured several papers from the HICSS Big Data minitrack. We are currently assessing other journals, such as the Communications of the Association for Information Systems (CAIS), to determine how to prepare special issues on Big Data and Analytics.  Other Conferences: A survey of other conferences indicates that many are run by commercial organizations, such as the Big Data Conference 2019, Government Big Data Conference 2019, 2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, O’Reilly’s Strata 2019, and many others, etc. All attest to the importance of this topic in the business, scientific, and governmental domains. Many of these seemed to focus on data warehousing, data querying, data mining, and data science. The major professional societies sponsor several big data conferences which demonstrate its major importance to academia, industry, and government.  Many conferences have a big data component, e.g., sessions that offer papers on big data, but none seemed to offer the same focus as proposed for this minitrack. We expect the competition to get more intense in succeeding years, so we are trying to establish this minitrack as a preferred venue for Big Data papers.  Marketing Plan We email a Call for Papers to a mailing list of over 200 practitioners, authors, etc. who have submitted or attended our minitracks and tutorials. In addition, we submit the CFP to various professional societies, university programs with Big Data, Data Analytics, Data Science, and similar types of programs. We continually enhance our mailing list each year through contacts and other means.  Target Journals for Paper Publication: There are several journals and professional society we could target for special issues comprised of papers arising from this minitrack.  IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (for parallel analytics) IEEE Proceedings (perhaps a special issue?) IEEE Transactions on Services Computing IEEE Systems Journal IEEE Computer INFORMS Information Systems Research INFORMS Management Information Systems Quarterly  INFORMS Management Science INFORMS Organization Science INFORMS Operations Research INFORMS Decision Analysis INFORMS Analytics Journal of Management Information Systems Data Warehouse Institute Business Intelligence Journal ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data Communications of the ACM ACM Computing Surveys (for survey papers on specific topics)  We will attempt to line up at least one special issue of a relevant IEEE journal if the accepted papers merit archival publication.

Goel, Illinois State University, USA and Kiel Institute for the World Economy, Germany    Stefan Voß, University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany (primary contact)    Topics description (at most 150 words):   Digital innovation is a much-discussed phenomenon which is not confined to a specific domain and  transcends both functional and geographical borders. Despite its increasing popularity in both academia  and practice, the concept of digital innovation remains under-theorized and often poorly grasped. This is  also demonstrated by a lack of common guidance and standards pertaining to digital innovation.  The objective of this minitrack is to explore digital innovation from diverse perspectives to adequately  grasp the phenomenon and to put some special emphasis on digital innovation in a networked world. In  this respect, networks can be any types of networks, be it social networks, electricity networks,  telecommunications networks, supply chain networks and alike.     Minitrack description:    Digitalisation, digital transformation and alike are most prominent buzzwords of today. This includes  digital innovation. While popular, the term is often not clearly defined and used interchangeably with  other concepts, such as digitisation and digital transformation. At its core, digital innovation incorporates  the processes and outcomes of innovation subject to the use of digital technologies and digitised  components. In this respect, digital innovation not only describes novel innovation practices but also the  creation of novel products, processes and services. As examples, one may look at the overwhelming  developments in the area of social networks or even the upcoming changes regarding smart ports in the  context of maritime shipping. Accordingly, digital innovation can also be seen as an instigator for digital  transformation, which characterizes the process of fundamentally changing and restructuring  organisational components such as processes and business models as well as whole domains and  industries through the use of digital technologies. That is, as the term digital innovation can be used to  describe both the processes and the outcomes of innovation using digital technologies, it also encompasses  digital transformation.  Digital innovation is not confined to a single domain, it rather disperses throughout a broad variety of  areas of study and industries. This is demonstrated by the manifold literature available on digital  innovation. With the increasing diffusion of digital solutions in a broad range of industries and the  increased attention it attracts, the distinction between information technology (IT) and other disciplines as  well as products and services becomes blurred. As most companies increasingly rely on a well-established  IT infrastructure to operate successfully, digital technologies become ever more diffused, IT has become a  necessity rather than an asset. To set themselves apart from the competition it therefore does not suffice  anymore for organisations to invest in IT and digital technologies, but they need to find innovative and  transformative applications for digital technologies to generate an edge over their competition. The value  offered by digital technologies is not represented in itself but in its diverse applications, resulting in digital  innovation and transformation. With digital innovation at the heart of many future economic and scientific  developments and as a phenomenon that is here to stay, its growth in significance is undeniable.   This minitrack aims to support the research in digital innovation by accommodating original contributions  from researchers working in all possible aspects of digital innovation. This is done from various  viewpoints like systems engineers, business analytics and information systems specialists as well as  economists, just to name a few, underlying the interdisciplinary and multifaceted character of digital  innovation, especially focusing on networks and networked systems. Topics include but are not limited to  behaviour analysis, regulation, network design, policy and management, mobile services growth models,  pricing of internet service providers (ISP), interplay of QoS and price, network effects and network  externalities.  Extended papers from this minitrack are expected to be fast-tracked for a special issue of the journal  Netnomics (Springer)with Rajeev K Goel as guest editor.

The following  three years had the same title but with specifications at HICSS-37 and HICSS-38: Core business  technology and intelligent support. The next year at HICSS-39 the mini-track title was changed  to better catch the challenges of mobile commerce, the mini-track was renamed to Mobile  Value Service. For many years the concept mobile value services has been at the core of the  mini-track. In 2019 the theme was changed to better meet new challenges and the mini-track  was renamed to Digital Mobile Services for Everyday Life.    During the last 25 years, the advancements of digital technologies have enhanced our lives in a  myriad of ways. Services deploying various types of mobile and other digital technologies are  developed predominantly first to consumer markets all over the world to improve the quality of  consumers’ everyday life. The worldwide number of mobile subscriptions alone - over 8.3 billion  - means that there is more than one subscription per each adult. We assume that the vast com- munity of mobile and other digital technologies and services users will continue to generate in- novations and value from the deployment of these technologies. For example, the ongoing im- plementation of 5G networks and Internet of Things (IoT) devices will enable a range of new ser- vices and business cases transforming even more our everyday life from business activities to  leisure time. In relation to legacy information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT),  smartphones and other mobile devices are used not only to access networks, information sys- tems and data storages but also to augment them with innovative mobile applications. Covid-19  pandemonium facilitated a digital leap, also in the deployment and use of mobile services. Our  understanding of business models, platforms and their governance, ecosystems, privacy and the  value creation mechanisms of digital mobile services has not grown fast enough to fully cover  the influences of all new technological developments. Further knowledge and theory building  are needed to establish sound dynamic models over the phenomena, to derive theoretical ex- planations, or to provide solid guidance to the users, developers and regulators of digital ser- vices. On the other hand, it is vital to also advance our understanding of the individual technol- ogy user; the acceptance, adoption, use and sustained use of technology within the sphere of  everyday life. Within this area, there is also a necessity to encourage research involving less  studied consumer groups, such as age groups above and beyond working age, users of assistive  technologies, users with disabilities, technology non-users and minorities. Further, digital ser- vices are increasingly present in non-commercial contexts; in a wide range of public services,  civic engagement, non-governmental organizations and charity, as well as the whole gamut of  human activities outside the professional realm – culture, exercise, entertainment, spirituality  and so on. Simply, digital services permeate all aspects of life; they impact and transform the  ways we live our lives and spend our days.     We encourage methodological diversity and novel research approaches and models to study this  multifaceted phenomenon. For example, user and service usage data, or usage pattern se- quences can be used e.g., for customer profiling, marketing and to develop new value-adding  services but it also gives researchers an objective view on individuals’ technology usage and the  means to investigate usage patterns, rhythms and configurations as well as the possibility to dis- cover unexpected phenomena. Qualitative work can yield rich insights into individuals’ motiva- tions and decision making. Methods used in user experience studies, such as eye-tracking and  usability studies, shed light on unconscious thought processes and emotions. Creative, well-de- signed research, regardless of the chosen method, is needed to achieve the goal of the mini-tra  ck since its very start in 2002: to offer research contributions that open up new perspectives and  insights for the better deployment and use of mobile and other digital technologies, services  and applications.    In this mini-track, we have also followed the development of such digital payment services of- fered to consumers - especially mobile payments – that are used to pay for consumers’ everyday  life purchases. The first mobile payment was made over 20 years ago, in 1998, and first research  articles were published in 1999-2000. Mobile payments and mobile banking, fintech included,  continue to be active research streams with lots of unsolved research questions. More recently,  virtual tokens, central bank virtual currencies (CBVC) and other virtual currencies have emerged  as payment alternatives for everyday purchases of digital and other services. Research on con- temporary mobile and virtual payment services, their platforms and ecosystems, comparisons  between developed and emerging countries’ use of mobile and virtual payments, as well as arti- cles about other mobile and virtual payment issues are warmly welcome. Digital mobile pay- ment services, however, are still only one topic within this mini-track.     It appears that research will have to tackle an increasing number of challenges and we invite re- search contributions that open up new and innovative perspectives and thus offer insight for a  better understanding on mobile and other digital services in any area of everyday life. The re- search may focus on the design, implementation, usage, regulation and/or evaluation of digital  technologies, services and applications.      Relevant topics for this mini-track include (but are not limited to):   •  Business models related to   o  Mobile and other digital Productivity and Enterprise Applications  o  Single-sided, dual-sided or multisided mobile and digital service platforms, their eco- systems and governance  •  Digital Mobile Services in a business/organizational setting  o  Design, development, implementation and/or continued use of business apps, inte- gration with business platforms and architectures  o  Mobile and other digital business apps for commerce, marketing and business oper- ations  o  Mobile services used to augment business applications, for example status, location  or flow of goods, money or data  •  Digital Mobile Services in consumer settings  o  Consumer initiated and co-created digital services, consumer feedback  o  Usage patterns of digital technologies, services and applications,   o  Social privacy issues, social inclusion   •  Business value of digital mobile services  •  Mobile payments, virtual payments, mobile banking, comparisons of traditional mobile pay- ment services with cryptocurrency/virtual currency payment services  o  Competition of mobile and virtual payment platforms for consumer, merchant,  identity service provider and other stakeholder attention  o  Business architectures of mobile and virtual payment services, platforms, recogni- tion and other technologies, mobile use of virtual currencies and tokens  •  Digital services for young elderly (60 +)  •  Wearable devices and digital coaching  •  Integrated location-based services  •  Adoption and diffusion of digital services         Marketing plan:  We will distribute the call for papers to those who attended our mini-track in 2021, as well as  those from previous years, members of the IS-community in Europe as well as all our colleagues  globally. We will also send invitations to known mobile payment researchers, most of whom we  know and/or have met in person. Our goal is to attract approximately 20 submissions and to have  9 accepted papers in 3 paper sessions.

Box 35 FIN-40014 University of Jyväskylä Finland tuure@tuunanen.fi   Primary contact: Tuure Tuunanen Central Theme: The purpose of the minitrack is to attract research on the innovation, design, development, management, and use of digital services and the digitalization of services. The key drivers in this area of research are the multiplying technological opportunities for digital services, such as ubiquitous connectivity, artificial intelligence, wearable devices, cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things (IoT), virtual/augmented reality, and so on. The minitrack provides a discussion forum for researchers interested theoretical and practical problems related to such services .  In a broad sense, digital services can be defined as systems that enable value co-creation and limit value co-destruction through the development and implementation of ICT enabled processes that integrate system value propositions with customer value drivers . Such services meld the worlds of bits and atoms and promise to transform the transportation, energy, and other sectors like the media industries before them. They draw on different technologies such as sensors, real-time analytics of data, augmented and virtual realities, computer hardware, software, and human and system actors. Such technologies form a service platform where different actors  assemble the service together, in situ, as argued by Grönroos . As a result, the embedded systems of today and the Internet-of-things of tomorrow are the precursors for the upcoming era of cybernized services . Examples of such services are, e.g., biomedical and healthcare systems such as telerobotic surgery, (semi)autonomous vehicles and intelligent highways, augmented human capabilities with body net sensors and virtual reality, and intelligent machines.  Furthermore, there are substantial opportunities for ICT and digitalization driven service innovation in industrial and business-to-business settings. These opportunities exist particularly in manufacturing in which innovation activities increase the digitization of products and production processes. We see that the global awareness of the power of the manufacturing industry will be linked to horizontal cyber-physical systems that enable value co-creation and co-destruction in the networked business environment. The cyber-aspects of such systems are ICT infrastructure, computer hardware, software, and different kind of sensors and actors. These components turn cyber-physical systems into platforms for designing and operating service. The data on products and processes gained through networked cybernized services and the ability to act on this data through control systems and actors enables novel ways of co-creating service in industrial contexts.  This emerging area of research raises interesting questions . For example, traditional development approaches focus on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of organizational processes. The design of such services may, however, require an emphasis on the socio-psychological aspects, such as the value-in-use and user/consumer/co-creator experiences. Digital services create novel ways of engaging customers and other actors in service ecosystems, raising the question of effective patterns of such digital actor engagement . Moreover, digital services facilitate data-driven and analytics-based service design and development, particularly if the service is linked to the physical world through sensors and/or people’s interactions. Discussion Topics: The shift of consumer and enterprise personnel from users to co-creators and co-destructors of value, calls for a significant re-appraisal of our current design and development approaches. Relevant topics for this minitrack include (but are not limited to):  Digital and ICT enabled services, industrial services, mobile services, and consumer information services and systems Discovery, fuzzy-front end, and innovation processes  Service design, and development processes and methodologies Analytics supported service design and development Design and evaluation of novel digital services Service ecosystems, platforms and novel architecture  Consumer and enterprise user aspects Service ecosystems and effective patterns of actor engagement in digital services Social networking  Temporo-spatial relevance of service, location and/or sensor aware services Hedonic ICT enabled services  Socio-psychological aspects of ICT enabled service use Understanding social and cultural contexts Consumerization of enterprise services  Cyber-Physical and IoT enabled services, Cybernized Services: Cyber-Physical and IoT enabled services from different disciplinary perspectives, such as, information systems, operations research, software engineering, service science, and service research Service innovation based on Cyber-Physical and IoT enabled services  Cyber-Physical and IoT service ecosystems, platforms and novel architecture  Theoretical aspects of Cyber-Physical and IoT enabled services research Cyber-Physical and IoT enabled services as artifacts Use and adoption of Cyber-Physical and IoT enabled services  Artificial-intelligence enabled services: Service Robots and Service Robot enabled services Services enabled by natural language assistants Human-machine interaction in AI-enabled services New technology enabled services, e.g. services using smart television, smart watches, wearables, mobile devices and phones or other technologies like augmented/virtual reality, blockchain, IoT etc. Topics Covered in earlier HICSS and Other Conferences and Publications Last year, the minitrack successfully attracted six accepted papers, leading to two lively and well-attended session, including some social media buzz about the sessions. The minitrack continues also to build on a community from previous minitracks on the design and development of mobile consumer and enterprise services. Recent special issues on digital services in leading journals testify about the growing interest in the area: MIS Quarterly’s special issue on Service Innovation in the Digital Age, J. of Service Research’s special issue on ICT enabled services , and J. of Management Information Systems special issue on IS in services . The proposed minitrack aims to build on these research communities. Lastly, it should be emphasized that the minitrack is broad in the sense that the covers the service lifecycle from innovation to development. However, at the same time, it strives to avoid overlap with other mini-tracks by not explicitly citing digital and digitalized services related topics such as supply-chains, e-government, outsourcing and offshoring, e-learning, or service quality.

It isn’t surprising, then that our reality and lives are increasingly becoming  game-like (6). This is not limited to the fact that digital games have become a pervasive part of our lives, but  perhaps most prominently with the fact that activities, systems and services that are not traditionally perceived  as game-like are becoming either intentionally or unintentionally gameful (4; 6; 10; 13; 14).  Gamification refers to a “process of transforming any activity, system, service, product or organizational  structure into one which affords positive experiences, skills and practices similar to those afforded by games, and  is often referred to as the gameful experience. This is commonly but optionally done with an intention to facilitate  changes in behaviours or cognitive processes. As the main inspirations of gamification are games and play,  gamification is commonly pursued by employing game design” (6).  Gamification has become an umbrella concept that, to varying degrees, includes and encompasses other related  technological developments such as serious games (3), game-based learning (12; 24), exergames & quantified- self (8; 9; 21), games with a purpose/human-based computation games (17; 28), and persuasive technology (20).  Secondly, gamification also manifests in a gradual, albeit unintentional, cultural, organizational and societal  transformation stemming from the increased pervasive engagement with games, gameful interactions (6), game  communities and player practices. For example, recently we have witnessed the popular emergence of  augmented reality games (16; 17) and virtual reality technologies (2; 29) that enable a more seamless integration  of games into our physical reality. Case in point are urban spaces that are increasingly becoming playgrounds  for different games and -play activities. While location-based games such as Pokémon Go (1) were able to attract  millions of players, concepts such as Playable Cities (19) and Urban Gamification (26) highlight the large scale  changes that games are bringing about in the smart cities of the future. Moreover, the media ecosystem has  also experienced a degree of ludic transformation: with user generated content becoming an important  competitor for large media corporations. This transformation has led to the development of several emerging  phenomena such as the Youtube and modding cultures (23; 27) and esports (7; 25), that have penetrated the  cultural membrane allowing games to seep into domains hitherto dominated by traditional media.   We encourage a wide range of submissions from any disciplinary backgrounds: empirical and conceptual  research papers, case studies, and reviews.  Authors of accepted papers have the option to fast-track extended versions of their HICSS  papers to  Internet Research or AIS Transactions on Human-Computer Interaction.  Moreover, the Gamification mini-track is part of the Gamification Publication Track aimed at persistent  development of gamification research: http://gamifinconference.com/gamification-track/  Relevant topics include (but are not limited to):  •  Users: e.g. Engagement, experience, motivations, user/player types  •  Education: e.g. Serious games, game-based learning, simulation games  •  Media: e.g. eSports, streaming  •  Commerce: e.g. Game business models, free-to-play, gamification as marketing, adoption  •  Work: e.g. Organizational gamification, gameful work, games-with-a-purpose, playbour  •  Technology: e.g. VR, AR, MR, gameful wearables and IoT  •  Toys & playfulness  •  Health: e.g. Quantified-self, games for health, health benefits  •  Cities: e.g. smart cities, urban gamification, playable cities, community engagement, governance  •  Theories/concepts/methods: Contributions to science around gamification  TRACK CHAIRS    Juho Hamari (Primary Contact)    Tampere University  Nikoletta-Zampeta  Legaki  is  a  Marie  –  Curie  juho.hamari@tuni.fi  postdoctoral  researcher  at  Gamification  Group,  Tampere University.

Learning analytics (LA) has made a substantial and lasting impact on research and practice in learning  and teaching. Because of the vast amounts of data that is generated and gathered through the use of  interactive learning environments and learning management systems within educational settings, there  is an opportunity to develop data driven understandings of learning and teaching processes. More  recently, the  need  for  direct  involvement  of educational research in  learning analytic  has been  acknowledged as  a first  fundamental pillar  of learning analytics to scaffold the research, i.e. to  ​ determine which learning theories should  be investigated so that appropriate data can be collected  and analyzed. The second pillar, capturing, refers to finding evidence of learning, by identifying and  ​ ​ explaining useful data for analysing and understanding teaching, learning, and developing methods  that  capture  and  model  learning. Then, understanding is associated with how learning theory is  ​ ​ informed by large-scaled data analysis, as well as the use of data science techniques to understand  specific aspects of teaching and learning. The final pillar is the impact on learning and teaching by  ​ providing decision support and feedback based on LA, such as through dashboards and early-alert  systems and personalised and adaptive learning. However, some things cannot be planned. During this  past year, we have witnessed a rapid shift towards blended and distance learning, involving an almost  overnight adoption of the necessary technology as the pandemic forced academic institutions to close  their doors and move activities online. The consequences of this transformation are still unknown both  in the short and the long term, such as the effects on learning and teaching strategies in e.g. (partially)  online settings. Only time will tell what the true impact will be, what the real benefits and serious  pitfalls are, as well as the difficulties we must overcome.     We welcome papers that address, reflect on, and relate to, the four pillars of learning analytics and  datafication in educational settings alongside papers that reflect on changes in learning platforms,  teaching practices, learning practices, and student profiling. Research on the effects of the pandemic  on teaching and learning are also of interest. Furthermore, analyzing teaching and learning behaviors  through  learning management systems (or learning platforms) through data-driven approaches or  through qualitative approaches, or even mixed methods. The interest extends to papers that shed light  on the type of data that is required to improve teaching and learning in different levels of education,  how data can be used to better understand, and improve, the educational environment, as well as to  papers discussing qualitative research on teaching and learning, where data is used to support these  processes. The interest is therefore not merely in big data and grand projects but also extends to the  use of small data that can support teaching or learning. The papers can take the point of departure  from the teacher’s side, or a student perspective, or even be written from the intersection between the  teachers’ and the students’ practices. In addition to that, the papers can take on challenges and benefits  for management, operations, practice or research.

Our goals are two-fold:     1. Create a forum for industry colleagues to share their insights such that they can be  incorporated into future teaching and research. This is a practical step in the process to  upskill our workforce.  2. Engage industry and academic colleagues to find collaboration opportunities.    Some people call the current wave of transformation “digital transformation.” We call it “service  transformation enabled by digital technologies.” The goal of this minitrack is to explore  applications of science and technology to real-world innovations through practitioner reports,  case studies, best practice examples, tutorials, challenges, issues, opportunities, tools,  techniques, and methodologies of emerging digital technologies. In many cases, practice is  ahead of academic research contributions.     Highlights:    ● To reduce the divide between theory and practice, we create a venue for practitioners to  share real-world applications of science and technology  ● Presenters: Practitioner(s) (one of the co-authors needs to be a practitioner)  ● Paper: short, 3-page executive summary  ● Format: IEEE Computer Society Format  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1krESV2zTVPtCMEbfpi_fNMFtflvyp_1TMO0AkDLpg5c/edit  ● Peer-reviewed  ● Accepted and presented papers will be published in the HICSS proceedings  (https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/39610) and considered for on-going  ​ ​ publication in one of the Business Expert Press Book Series ""Collaborative Intelligence:  People, AI, and the Future of Work"" or ""Service Systems and Innovations in Business and  Society.""    Advanced technical capabilities are revolutionizing business activities, processes, and business  models. The overall goal of any transformation, including service transformation, is to increase  the productivity and creativity (decision making, connectivity, innovation, and augmentation) of  individuals and organizations.     Practitioner research offers more directly applicable results and an opportunity to focus  academic attention and teaching where it is needed most. This is aligned with the ideals  promoted by the Responsible Research in Business and Management Network (RRBM), The  ​ ​ ​ HIBAR Research Alliance, and calls by the World Economic Forum and others. By offering a  ​ ​ ​ venue to highlight practice-based innovation, we hope to increase the pace of discovery and  application overall. Practitioner research serves as a two-way bridge between academic  research and the organizations on the front lines. We need to link robust research findings to  practitioner experiences across management, organizational contexts, architecture, and design  related to applications of science and technology. Possible themes/topics of this Minitrack  include, but are not limited to:    ● Data and Analytics  ○ Descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive analytics  ○ Machine, deep, quantum computing  ○ Data, text, web, and social media mining  ○ Data, information & knowledge management  ○ Design science, storytelling, and visual analytics  ● Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing  ○ Smart machines  ○ Hyperautomation  ○ Robotics/automation  ○ Trusted/responsible AI  ○ Intelligence augmentation  ○ AI Bias  ○ Networking & AI  ● Cybersecurity  ○ Blockchain & distributed ledger, federated learning  ○ Protecting endpoint/consumer devices  ○ Privatization, legal, risk, and compliance solutions  ○ Intelligence, response, and orchestration with data and analytics  ○ Data, network security products, and strategies  ● Internet of Things  ○ Mobile services & technologies  ○ Data processing with edge computing  ○ Personalization of the retail, financial, healthcare e-commerce experience  ○ Energy and resource management  ○ Reliable, scalable, and secure wireless access  ● Service-Oriented Technology & Management  ○ Cloud computing  ○ Service computing  ○ Platforms & service ecosystems  ○ Collaboration systems and technologies  ○ Serverless computation  ○ Network-as-a-Service  ○ Data-, analytics, and -information-as-a-service  ○ X-as-a-service  ○ Responsible innovation  ● Digital government  ○ Smart government: Smart city solutions for the public service landscape  ○ Multichannel citizen engagement  ○ Improving end-to-end public service delivery via unique digital identity  ○ Ethical technology and trust  ● Intelligent Augmentation & Virtual Reality  ○ Science and application of virtual reality and gaming  ○ Augmented reality for education, shopping, healthcare, tourism, etc.  ○ Augmented reality for navigating solutions  ● Logistics & Supply Chain Management  ○ Autonomous trucking  ○ Smart warehouse management and demand management solutions  ○ Robotic automated storage and retrieval  ○ IoT for transportation  ○ Location analytics  ● Future of Work  ○ Human-machine partnership  ○ Real-time and immersive collaboration  ○ Digital workplace operations  ○ Optimizing the employee experience  ○ New roles and jobs for future  ○ Lexicon of technology for diversity, inclusion, belonging  ● Web  ○ Nest generation social media & networking  ○ Application of search  ○ Digital marketing    Marketing Plan  The chairs and advisory board members are active in their organizations, professional  associations, and social media.

Thomas received his Dr. rer. nat. in Information Systems from Technische Universität München (TUM), and his Dipl.-Wi.-Ing. in Business Engineering from KIT. He has acted as a consultant and engineer for organizations, such as the European Parliament and Lufthansa, and has worked as a Visiting Scientist at IBM Research in New York.   The proposed minitrack titled “Service Analytics” deals with research areas at the intersection of the technical areas service science and analytics (operations research). This is a recently evolving, distinct area of research that holds the potential to significantly improve service providers’ ability to better utilize the data accruing daily in the service systems they are involved in. This will inter alia allow organizations to 1) make better use of their deployable resources, 2) support strategic decision-making and offer more customer-friendly service contracts, 3) use customer and systems information to create new service offerings and business models (e.g. predictive maintenance services), and 4) make more sense of their existing knowledge and enable sustainable learning over several years of service provision. The themes of this minitrack are congruent with the “Decision Analytics, Mobile Services and Service Science” track’s dimensions “Analytics” and “Service Science”, in exploring the use of analytical techniques and decision support to enhance the outcomes of provider-customer service systems. Additionally, the proposed minitrack encourages the presentation work that touches upon the remaining dimension “Mobile Services”, which constitute a main source of the ever-increasing amount of service-related data, one of the drivers of the fast-growing importance of the service analytics field. Publicity for the proposed minitrack will be created through a combination of vehicles: 1) It will be advertised on our research institute’s web presence, 2) It will be advertised and explained in the course of events hosted at our research institute with international audience, including the annual “Service Summit” at Karlsruhe, 3) We will directly contact notable Professors and departments in the areas of service science and operations research, and professional service research communities (through Jim Spohrer, IBM) to solicit contributions to the minitrack and to raise awareness of its scientific relevance.   Karlsruhe Service Research Institute (KSRI) endorses my involvement in HICSS-55 as a minitrack chair and will pay for my travel expenses and registration cost to attend the conference. "

Description of the minitrack We plan to continue to organize this minitrack to bring together researchers and practitioners working in the field of service science, the interdisciplinary study of service that combines perspectives from fields of science, management, engineering, and design to innovate service systems. With strong support by leading IT companies, such as IBM, service science has already had a global impact, with hundreds of universities worldwide already offering courses, programs, or degrees related to service science, and with dozens of academic research institutes and groups appearing. Since HICSS-41, the minitrack has accepted 106 papers (acceptance rate less than 40% over the last five years), and published some of the best in the journals, Information Systems and e-Business Management and INFORMS Service Science. This minitrack has been a platform for researchers and practitioners from around the world to share work and exchange ideas. If approved for 2022, this minitrack will continue to be a major forum for sharing state-of-the-art research results and further development of this emerging discipline, and HICSS will remain a leading venue for service science.  Service science deals with the design, development, and managerial issues concerning “service systems,” integrated, value-creating configurations of service providers, their clients, their partners, and others. The best-performing service systems are IT-enabled, customer-centered, relationship-focused, and knowledge-intensive – yet span multiple formal and informal organizations. Because of this multidisciplinary context, researchers and practitioners in management, social sciences, and computer sciences are all working to increase service innovation. These multiple perspectives can be unified using the theoretical construct of the service system, in which entities (people, businesses, government agencies, etc.) interact to co-create value via value propositions that describe dynamic re-configurations of resources. In fact, over the last few years of this minitrack, this framework of value creation in complex service systems, which requires elaborating various stakeholder perspectives and understanding the broad context of use for specific cases to enable effective value creation especially given advanced and autonomous technology, has emerged as the central unifying framework across many papers and presentations. If approved for 2022, the minitrack will focus on papers that connect rigorous disciplinary research with the emerging interdisciplinary framework of value creation in service systems, focusing particularly on innovation, technology, and the digital economy. As ever more people in academia and industry recognize the need for service innovation, HICSS remains an excellent venue for this emerging discipline. The HICSS community can continue to play a leadership role. To that end, this minitrack will encourage submission of research papers from a variety of disciplines and a variety of participating communities to address issues in service policies, service process modeling, service delivery management, innovative service technologies, and the role of the Internet, the digital economy, and information technology. We will encourage submissions related to autonomous service systems, the use data and information for value creation, and computational modeling of complex, human-centered service systems, particularly with applications for the digital economy.   1b.

Dr. Paul P. Maglio is a professor of management, Chair of the Department of Management of Complex Systems, and Director of the Division of Management and Information at the University of California, Merced. He holds a bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering from MIT and an M.S. and a Ph.D. in cognitive science from the University of California at San Diego. One of the founders of the field of service science, Dr Maglio served as Editor-in-Chief of the INFORMS journal Service Science (2013-2018), serves as an editorial board member of the Journal of Service Research, and serves as lead editor of the Handbook of Service Science (with Volume II published in 2018). Dr. Maglio founded the California Center for Service Science at the University of California. He is an ACM Distinguished Scientist, and has published many scientific papers in various areas of computer science, cognitive science, and service science.   2. Technical area The trend of increasing contributions to economic outputs from services-related activities in major countries pushes the focus on service innovation to be a major part of most business models. Even in traditionally manufacturing-driven industries, such as IT and related industries, the importance of service has surpassed most other corporate competencies. From the outset, efforts in creating, composing, and delivering services call for systematic studies of managerial, technical, and social issues. Pioneers in service research have moved service research up to the inflection point, and now there is a great need of a wider range of service research. Combining managerial, organizational, and technical perspectives, service science research and education aims to create service professionals with technological, business, and social-organizational abilities. This minitrack will continue to serve as a primary forum for researchers and practitioners to share progress in the pursuit of answering these and related questions. In HICSS-41, we received 25 submissions and accepted 15 papers; in HICSS-42, we received 14 and accepted 9; in HICSS-43, we received 18 and accepted 9; in HICSS-44, we received 21 and accepted 10; in HICSS-45, we received 12 and accepted 8; in HICSS-46, we received 17 and accepted 9; in HICSS-47, we received 17 and accepted 9; in HICSS-48, we received 19 and accepted 9; in HICSS-49, we received 15 and accepted 7, in HICSS-50, we received 16 and accepted 6; in HICSS-51, we received 10 and accepted 3; in HICSS-52, we received 13 and accepted 6; in HICSS-53, we received 13 and accepted 6; and in HICSS-54, we received 11 and accepted 4. We expect to receive enough papers to organize one or two presentation sessions.  Though in prior years, this minitrack had fairly general calls-for-papers, encouraging submissions from a range of areas, in the last five years, it had a more narrow focus on service theory, service design, service innovation, service engineering, and service technology. In 2022, we will continue our narrow focus. Specifically, the Service Science minitrack will focus on the use of information technology and the effects of the digital economy on services, including but not limited to: (1) the increasing capabilities of technologies in service, such as autonomous technologies, and the roles of people and technologies in creating autonomous service systems; (2) the increasingly large role played by data and information in complex service systems, including the ways sensing and analytics influence value creation in the digital economy and potential ethical challenges created by the sorts of data collection and analyses that can now be conducted in real-time; and (3) the potential for computational modeling techniques, such as agent-based simulation, to inform the theory and design of complex, human-centered service systems, especially in the digital context, such as blockchain technologies, internet of things, etc.   3. Community Development for Service Science  The emergence of service science as a research discipline has made a global impact.  A number of conferences, symposia, and workshops related to service science have appeared over the last few years, but none of these are dedicated to development of research and theory for service systems and service science in an informal and edgy setting. HICSS, since its launch 55 years ago, has been exploring new ideas and frontiers within the realm of system sciences, and therefore makes the perfect venue for this multidisciplinary study of services from a system standpoint. The HICSS community in particular, with its unique multidisciplinary focus, can and should lead service science development. Our minitrack will continue to facilitate the shaping of the service science research agenda and the development of the service science research community at HICSS.   4. Statements Institutes of two co-chairs endorse our involvement in the HICSS minitrack and that the travel and registration cost to attend HICSS will be covered. At least one minitrack chair will attend the conference.  The collaboration of three co-chairs for this minitrack is necessary.  We commit our best efforts to promoting this minitrack to connect with the global knowledge networks on service science.  Professor Lin’s university is the frontier university to promote service science education and research, and through the international networks of the Service Science Society of Taiwan, Professor Lin could strengthen the link with other institutes world-wide to make this minitrack as a major outlet of their research results.  Professor Maglio was the global leader of service science at IBM, and given his roles as a professor in the School of Engineering at the University of California, Merced, and director of the California Center for Service Science, his being a minitrack co-chair will help the HICSS community reach out to practitioners and engineers, as well as the core service science community around the world through his leadership of the INFORMS journal Service Science (as immediate past Editor-in-Chief). The partnership between the two co-chairs will help bring together Information Systems academic research, industrial practices, and the global service science academic network. We plan to explore interesting synergy in this minitrack by reaching out to the related yet distinct communities that the co-chairs represent."

The  submissions can be research papers, case studies, or practitioner reports related to service  development and their implications.     After hosting minitracks on Open Data and “Openness” in service research agenda HICSS- 48 and HICSS-49, as well as HICSS-50 and HICSS-51 minitracks on open services and  service platforms, HICSS-52 minitrack on new blockchain uses, and HICSS-54 ministrack  on Smart Mobility Services, we now propose a HICSS-55 minitrack second edition of the  Smart Mobility Services.    Selected papers of the minitrack will be fast-tracked to a special issue of Electronic  Markets - The International Journal on Networked Business  (http://www.electronicmarkets.org/ ).    Proposed Topic:    Transportation  is  changing  and  this  change  is  driven  by  technology-driven  trends:  Autonomy, Connectivity, Electrification and diverse mobility business models of Shared  vehicles. At the same time there is a drive towards more sustainable transportation. Digital  platforms and services are essential for orchestrating sustainable smart mobility service  ecosystems: data that represents accurately for instance location of passengers and service  providers,  weather,  usage  and  maintenance  is  a  cornerstone  for  service  design.  Identification and communication systems that link specific physical things to specific  digital addresses offer possibilities to communicate, transact, pay, build trust, sense and  activate “things” from the internet – and design novel services based on this generated data.  Autonomous vehicles, electric cars and mobility related sharing economy services are all  build on platform thinking, as do many services reducing the need for travel to begin with.     Autonomous vehicles have been hailed as harbingers of new kinds of mobility and travel  services. Autonomous cars seem to be a bit further away from wider prevalence than  expected a couple of years ago, but the data gathered for them and available from e.g. smart  city initiatives and mobile devices provides great opportunities for smart mobility services,  related to both private and public transportation. Shipping industry, especially in cargo  shipping,  has  already  many  ongoing  advanced  projects  and  pilots,  and  in  aviation,  autonomous  aircrafts  are  being  developed  by  several  companies.  In  closed  and/or  hazardous  environments,  such  as  mines,  autonomous  vehicles  are  already  working.  Autonomous vehicles in land, see and air (e.g. drones) are expected to decrease costs and  increase efficiency and safety, but a host of regulatory, safety, legal and security challenges  are yet to be resolved.    More acutely, electric cars are increasingly embraced by car owners and they require their  own set of infrastructure and services. Full scale charging infrastructure needs building,  and it requires a lot of mobile services to support it. Some are simple, like applications that  show location and availability of charging station, and some more complex, like payment  systems for charging and in the near future for trading electricity stored in car batteries,  which can be used in smart grid to balance peaks of consumption. Societal benefits of  moving from fossil fuels to electricity in terms of reduction of pollution are quite clear, but  in addition to insufficient charging infrastructure, limited driving range, high costs and  battery issues still act as barriers to wider acceptance.    At the same time there is a growing concern about sustainability of current practices of  mobility and travel. Mobility related sharing economy services as well as different types  of fleet services are seen as viable options to privately owned cars, but they have their own  challenges, like added congestion in cities, reconfiguring existing modes of (especially  public) transportation, disrupting incumbent industries and widening the power imbalance  between the platform owners and “independent contractors”. These services require the  ability to connect to these specific platforms and seem to be prone to strong location and  availability-based network effects. Examples of these services are on one hand Uber and  Lyft type of services and on the other hand, in the near future, autonomous transportation  of people as well as cargo through fleets of autonomous vehicles on land, water and air.    At the same time concerns about e.g. business traveling has become acute in many  countries and there are movements to limit both work and leisure travel when possible.  Could smart digital services and apps offer alternatives for travel, or could there be  services that propose the best ways to limit the carbon footprint of travel?    In addition to usage of mobility value services, we are also interested in their development,  design  and  service  innovation.  Furthermore,  social,  societal  and  potential  customer  segmentation issues are of great interest. In this proposed minitrack we take stock of what  is the state of the art in current mobility services and mobility service ecosystems and what  is coming in the near future.    As HICSS is addressing leading edge developments, we especially encourage submissions  on new subareas, such as, sustainable travel services, autonomous transportation services,  and privacy and security concepts.     Relevant topics for this minitrack include (but not limited to):     •  Interplay of transportation ecosystems and mobility services (ecosystem)  •  Smart traffic services  •  Autonomous and connected vehicle development  •  Autonomous vehicle (land, see, air) business models  •  User issues in different smart traffic services  •  Location-based services and business models related to mobility   •  Business value of transportation and mobility services   •  Data privacy and quality in mobility services  •  Data sharing and ownership issues hampering data utilization in mobility services  •  Sustainable travel services  •  Value added services for travelers (usage, location, maintenance data)  •  Business and societal issues related to autonomous vehicles (land, see, air)  •  Technological challenges of adaptivity of services    Topics Covered in earlier HICSS and Other Conferences and Publications    In HICSS-46 and HICSSS-48 a minitrack titled “Open Data Services” and in HICSS-49 a  minitrack titled “Digital Service Innovations based on ""Open"" Phenomena and Practices”,  HICSS-50 minitrack on “Open digital services and platforms” and HICSS-51 and HICSS- 52 on blockchain (all with the same organization) attracted a number of high-quality  submissions and resulted in interesting and continued discussion. In HICSS-51, HICSS-52  and HICSS-53, Blockchain was discussed in several different tracks, minitracks and other  papers scattered across the minitracks.     We are working together with several research networks that are relevant for the topic of  this minitrack. These include IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, AIS SIG Artificial  intelligence & Autonomous Application and AIS SIG Services.

Spohrer, PhD - IBM Almaden Research Center San Jose, CA 95120 USA , spohrer@gmail.com  408-829-3112  Haluk Demirkan, PhD - University of Washington – Tacoma  Phone: 1-253-692-5751     Coverage: Smart service systems are a growing topic of study in both the information systems and service science literature (Beverungen, Breidbach, Poeppelbuss, Tuunainen 2019; Maglio 2015; Barile & Polese 2010).  Smart service systems are ones that continuously improve (e.g., decision support, productivity, quality, compliance, sustainability, etc.) and co-evolve within all sectors (e.g., government, healthcare, education, finance, retail and hospitality, communication, energy, utilities, transportation, etc.).  Smart service systems adapt value co-creation interactions to a constantly changing environment including natural (pandemics) and human-made disasters (wars); wise service systems benefit all stakeholders, especially future generations of entities. Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) are key technology enablers of smart service systems along with improved sensors, robotics, miniaturization, energy efficiency, smart phones, online platforms, and other technology-side developments (Lim & Maglio 2018).  Smart service systems are also enabled by human-side advances in policies, regulations and education that advance rights, responsibilities and capabilities of actors and institutions.  (Larson 2016; Demirkan, Bess, Spohrer, Rayes  Allen, Moghaddam 2015).   The research agenda for smart service systems is still rapidly evolving (Wuenderlic, Heinonen, Ostrom , Patricio, Sousa, Voss, Lemmink 2015, Lim & Maglio 2019).   Researchers, entrepreneurs and policymakers can be viewed as innovators working to improve quality-of-service for actors, quality-of-life for citizens and quality-of-returns for investors.  Applying the appropriate management, organizational, architectural, technological and design methodologies related to this innovation of smarter and wiser service systems is much needed. This mini-track invites practitioner and academics interested in advancing our understanding of principles of design of smart service systems to submit papers.  This mini-track also invites scholars, policymakers, and entrepreneurs from around the globe and across business and societal sectors with diverse perspective on the topic of transforming from smart service systems to wise service systems to submit papers. Possible topics of applied, field and empirical research include, but are not limited to: - Design Science and smart service systems - New practice and theoretical perspectives on smart service systems - Technology-side innovation in smart service systems - Human-side innovation in smart service systems - AI advances and smarter and wiser service systems - Customer/stakeholder experiences in smarter service systems - Service-Dominant Logic (S-D Logic) and smart service systems - Viable Systems Approach and smart service systems - Service Science and smart service systems - Business models and public policy for smarter and wiser service systems - Super-smart self-service technologies - Super-powers for people with augmented perception and intelligence - Labor and capital platforms as smart service systems - Upskilling for smarter and wiser service systems - Service-oriented enterprise and smart service systems - Analytics, cognition, and innovation for smart service systems - Cognitive computing and intelligent decision support - Work practices (agile, open source, service design growth mindset, etc.) for smart service systems - Smart industry, smart cities, smart families, smart living/quantified self – via digital twins - Society 5.0 transformation from smarter service systems to wiser service systems - Ethical challenges related to smart service systems - Enabling intelligence augmentation with AI  History: Previous HICSS Tracks/Minitracks and Conferences: The first version of this mini-track was offered in 2007 HICSS as “Towards the “Service Oriented Enterprise”. When it was offered in HICSS 40, the mini-track had two sessions on Saturday, January 6, 2007 with almost full attendance. It had three sessions during HICSS 41 and HICSS 42, had two sessions during HICSS 43, 44 and 45. Although there is some overlap with the “Service Science” mini-track (used to be called “SSME - Service Science Management and Engineering” mini-track), that mini-track focuses on a broad view of service science. We are looking for more specific, targeted research that enables innovation of smart service systems with analytics-enabled human and cognitive systems. During the symposium that we co-chaired on Cloud and Grid Computing during HICSS 43 and HICSS 44, there was a great deal of interest generated in this topic. We offered a mini-track titled “Service Systems and Cloud Computing Services” in HICSS 46 and “Analytics and Design-led Innovations & Management Minitrack” in HICSS 47.  In the most recent two years, we offered this track in HICSS 48 with 1 session, in HICSS 49 with 2 sessions, in HICSS 50, 51, 52 and 53 with 1 session in each.  “Smart Service Systems: Analytics, Cognition and Innovation” mini-track has managerial and technical foci, and it is more consistent with emerging visions of how organizations can innovate smart service systems that enable co-creation of value. There may be also some overlap with the IEEE Services Computing Conference, but the focus of that conference is directed more toward networked economic structures intended to support new business models. One of the major differences between the proposed mini-track vs. most others is that we invite a practitioner to be a part of this MT. This gives us an opportunity to evaluate submitted research papers with respect to relevance and impact. “Smart Service Systems with Analytics and Open Tech Artificial Intelligence Minitrack” for HICSS 54 was a tough year because of the pandemic, so we are looking forward to crafting a more precisely tuned mini-track for HICSS 55.

Taking profit from the main advantages of each individual technique, they can work  in a cooperative way to solve lots of complex real-world problems: those for which more  conventional methods have not yielded low cost, analytic, and complete solutions. Earlier  computational approaches could model and precisely analyze only relatively simple  systems. However, more complex systems arising in biology, health, economy, digital  world, and similar fields, often remained intractable to conventional mathematical and  analytical  methods.  Therefore,  the  advances  in  soft  computing  techniques  play  an  important role in analyzing and modeling more complex systems. Soft computing deals  with imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and approximation to achieve computability,  robustness  and  low  solution  cost,  which  can  better  deal  with  large-scale,  fast  and  unstructured changes that occur as part of the digital world.  This minitrack aims to attract researchers with an interest in the research area described  above. Specifically, not only contributions on theoretical innovations are welcome, but  also those describing different problem-solving benefits by using soft computing-based  methodologies, in particular, in the fields of digital world, digital coaching, digital health,  digital economy, and cognitive computing. We are interested in the contributions where  the applied/defined methodologies used are either analysis- or systems-oriented. They  may have an experimental or empirical focus. Innovative studies are favored, which  combine innovative theoretical results with a careful empirical verification, or good  empirical problem solving, planning or decision making with innovative theory building.  A common denominator for all studies is the building and use of soft computing-based  models.   Topics appropriate for this minitrack include, but are not limited, to:  •  Machine learning.  •  Neural networks.  •  Support vector machines.  •  Fuzzy reasoning.  •  Fuzzy logic.  •  Fuzzy decision making.  •  Neuro fuzzy.  •  Evolutionary computation.  •  Evolutionary algorithms.  •  Genetic algorithms.  •  Differential evolution.  •  Swarm intelligence.  1    •  Bio-inspired systems.  •  Ant colony optimization.  •  Particle swarm optimization.  •  Bayesian networks.  •  Software for soft computing.  •  Natural language processing based on soft computing techniques.  Marketing plan, i.e, how do you plan to solicit papers  We will send emails with the information of this minitrack to the authors working in the  above topics.

This also incorporates issues  related to digital transformation in this area. Methods include optimization, heuristics, metaheuristics and  matheuristics, simulation, agent technologies, and descriptive as well as predictive methods. Recent  advances incorporating big data, cloud computing, and machine learning and data science in general are  especially welcome.     Minitrack description:    General prelude: This minitrack is a continuation of the successful minitrack “Intelligent Decision  Support for Logistics and Supply Chain Management” (or under a slightly different title) of HICSS-36  through HICSS-54. In each case, accepted papers were usually presented in one to three sessions. Often an  open forum on future issues of e-logistics and the minitrack took place. According to the trends in  decision science, the session in HICSS-54 was leaned towards the application of data science, specifically  machine learning. The sessions were usually attended by 15 to 20 people with exceptions in 2005 and  2017 where attendance was somewhat higher at about 20-25 and 2018 and 2019 when it was slightly  lower. Acceptance rate was usually around 50%. Due to Covid-19, HICSS-54 took place online where  some of the topics of the presented papers were vividly discussed.    Advertising the minitrack will be done by using established conferences (like the International Conference  on Computational Logistics website and address lists), LinkedIn groups (e.g., the Verolog list which is  affiliated with a European Working Group on vehicle routing and logistics) and collaboration networks,  e.g., the IFIP working group.     Content: Information technology (IT) and information systems (IS) are prerequisites and enablers for  successful supply chain management (SCM). With related advances, the logistics and SCM field is  developing very dynamically. We understand logistics as the management of all inbound and outbound  materials,  parts,  supplies,  and  finished  goods.  It  integrates  the  business  functions  purchasing,  transportation, and storage. SCM encompasses the logistics function extending to the provision of the  right product or service at the right time at the right place at the right costs. For that purpose, SCM deals  with the efficient management of related information, physical goods or services, as well as the financial  flows. Business-to-business transactions are made via the Internet and enterprise resource planning (ERP)  systems  support  managing  the  transactional  information  within  the  enterprise.  Cooperation  and  coordination are only possible based on IT and IS. While IT and IS are vital components in supply chains,  their successful management rests on intelligent and coordinated decision making throughout the logistics  network. Intelligent decision support and decision analytics using advanced decision technologies and  analytics  methodology  are  of  utmost  importance  in  logistics  and  SCM.  Sensor  networks,  RFID  deployment, social network activities, internet search histories and retail transactions are just a few  examples of sources to provide data to support efficient decision analytics. Big data issues are well  recognized and offer opportunities long waited for but also provide challenges in handling and decision  analytics. Cloud computing allows also small and medium sized enterprises to access resources to support  analytics functions. Business intelligence and data mining can be used to store and analyze logistics,  product, inventory, and sales information. Simulation and optimization, which can be found in advanced  planning and scheduling systems, can be employed for, e.g., logistics as well as inventory, production,  procurement, and distribution planning. Intelligent agents can, e.g., communicate with different partners in  the  supply  chain,  assist  in  collecting  information,  share  product  information,  negotiate  prices,  and  distribute alerts throughout the logistics networks. The design and implementation of intelligent decision  analytics tools to support human agents in computational logistics and SCM is a very active field in  research, consulting, and software development. Many such technologies or systems are continuously  being developed, implemented, and used in real-world scenarios. We do, therefore, believe that this  minitrack will be recognized by both the scientific community and practitioners developing or using  logistics and SCM solutions.   We aim at organizing a minitrack consisting of one to two sessions depending on the number of high- quality submissions. We seek papers dealing with decision analytics, business intelligence, big data, cloud  computing, and decision technologies which contribute to intelligent decision support in the whole field of  logistics and in all categories of SCM. This includes but is not restricted to simulation, optimization,  heuristics, metaheuristics, agent technologies, decision analytics, descriptive models, and data mining.  Optimization in dynamic situations is intended to be online optimization rather than the so-to-speak real- time  optimization  to  support  real-time  decision  making.  Recent  advances  in  data  science,  machine  learning and artificial intelligence successfully complement these methods. We are especially interested in  real-world applications and in information systems and software solutions which assist in solving decision  problems. This is extended towards, e.g., computational logistics, advanced planning systems, and the  intelligent use of ERP systems. Also, conceptual ideas, reports on projects in progress, and case studies  are welcome. Moreover, teaching cases both at the university as well as the executive level may be of  interest.

Title of a mini-track    Social Robots - Robotics and Toy Computing      2. The track that this mini-track belongs    Decision Analytics, Mobile Services & Service Science      3. Description of a mini-track  The pervasive nature of digital technologies as witnessed in the industry, services, and everyday life has  given rise to an emergent, data-focused economy stemming from many aspects of human individuals and the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT).  These  data’s  richness  and  vastness  are  creating  unprecedented  research  opportunities in many fields, including urban studies, geography, economics, finance, entertainment, social  science, physics, biology and genetics, public health, and many other smart devices. As businesses build out  emerging hardware and software infrastructure, it becomes increasingly important to anticipate technical and  practical challenges and to identify best practices learned through experience in this research area. A social  (companion) robot, such as SoftBank Robotics’ Pepper and ASUS’ Zenbo, consists of a physical humanoid  robot component that connects through a network infrastructure to online services that enhance traditional  robot functionality. Humanoid robots usually behave like natural social interaction partners for human users,  with features such as speech, gestures, and eye-gaze, referring to the users’ data and social background. The  usage behavior of users of anthropomorphic robots indicates that users are more open to robots. Some prior  research shows that it is much easier for an embodied humanoid robot to trust users to release their personal  information than a disembodied interactive kiosk. Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is a research area of  understanding, designing, and evaluating robots for use by or with humans from the social-technical  perspectives.  Recently AI technologies have been applied to robotic and toy computing. Robotic computing is one branch  of AI technologies, and their synergistic interactions enable by robots. Social robots now can easily capture  a user’s physical activity state (e.g., walking, standing, running, etc.) and store personalized information (e.g.,  face, voice, location, activity pattern, etc.) through the camera, microphone, and sensors by AI technologies.  Toy computing is a recently developing concept that transcends the traditional toy into a new computer  research area using AI technologies. A toy in this context can be effectively considered a computing device  or peripheral called Smart Toys. We invite research and industry papers related to these specific challenges  and others driving innovation in robotics and toy computing for social robots.  Based on the past five years of this mini-track in HICSS-50, HICSS-51, HICSS-52, HICSS-53, and HICSS- 54, the sixth year’s goal is to present both novel and industrial solutions to challenging technical issues as  well as compelling use cases. This mini-track will share related practical experiences to benefit the reader  and provide clear proof that robotic and toy computing technologies play an ever-increasing important and  critical role in supporting social robots - a new cross-discipline research topic in social science, computer  science, decision science, and information systems. With a general focus on social robots and their related  robotics and toy computing, this mini-track covers related topics such as:    •  Social Technical Issues  •  Human Behavior Study  •  Human-Robot Interaction  •  Business Models  •  Conceptual and Technical Architecture  •  Visualization Technologies  •  Modeling and Implementation  •  Security, Privacy, and Trust  •  Industry Standards and Solution Stacks    1 •  Provenance Tracking Frameworks and Tools  •  Case Studies (e.g., smart toys, healthcare, financial, aviation, etc.)    This proposed mini-track aims to crystallize this emerging research domain and trends into positive efforts  to focus on the most promising research and industrial solutions.

Together these technologies are expected to disturb existing markets like PCs and smartphones did when they were introduced (Goldman Sachs, 2016). Firms are encouraged to develop strategies on how to design and integrate these technologies with their businesses (Porter and Heppelmann, 2017). The first wave of VR came already in 1990’s when a number of industries were inspired by VR games (Botella et al., 1998; Wiederhold and Wiederhold, 1998; Jayaram et al., 1999). However, the user experience was still unpleasant and the hype soon passed. After 2005, a second wave of VR emerged and was more successfully employed in different fields such as engineering, medicine, mental health, design, architecture and construction, education, arts, entertainment, business, advertising, military and travel (Saggio and Ferrari, 2012; Zyda, 2005; Jayaram et al., 1999; Smyth, 2005; Huges et al., 2013). At the moment, device, component, software and user-interface development is going globally fast forward and many world-leading companies are adopting these technologies (Porter and Heppelmann, 2017).  Current academic research with regards to VR, AR and MR technologies has mainly concentrated on the technology itself. Thus, there is a research gap in studying user experiences, decision-making and technology development side-by-side in order to understand the value-in-use these technologies create. The key value drivers for users are, for example, cost-saving through out-of-home and out-of-office access, total control and high level of personalization, going beyond reality, personal efficacy experiences, feeling of safety, privacy and confidentiality and immersive experiences (Botella et al., 1998; 2004; Côté and Bouchard, 2005; Gorini and Riva, 2008; Repetto and Riva, 2011; Riva, 2005; Riva et al., 2004; Wiederhold and Wiederhold, 1998; Zimand et al., 2003). During the pandemic, these utilities have become even more important and demand on these technologies have been increasing (Singh et al. 2020).  From this point of view, the major challenge for VR, AR and MR technologies is to convince not only customers but also service personnel with the value proposition that are additional and high enough to compete with the current systems and offerings available in desktops, tablets, smartphones and video and game-like applications. The minitrack will concentrate on showcasing research on technology and application development with specific orientation towards user experience and behaviour. Interesting research avenues are, for example, user decision-making, customer value and service design. Customer value-guided development of the technologies and consequent innovative business models are some of the expected outcomes. As HICSS addresses cutting edge interdisciplinary developments, we encourage submissions from both technology and business development perspectives.  Fields of research that can contribute to the minitrack include computer science, information systems science, e-commerce, decision-making or any scholarly or industry field developing MR, AR and VR applications. We welcome contributions from all contexts and industries. Previously, there has been an emphasis on healthcare, e-commerce, travel, sports, education and industrial solutions, but new areas are welcome as well. We seek empirical and conceptual research papers, methodological papers, quantitative analyses, case studies, reviews and practitioner reports. In addition to the regular HICSS criteria, the degree of novelty in both the technology employed and innovativeness of the application is given considerable weight in the evaluation of the papers.   We welcome all entries related to Virtual reality  Augmented reality Mixed reality Immersive technologies In the context of services, products, business, economy, psychology, computer science, computer graphics, geomatics, land-use, urban science, human-computer interaction and analytics. The example approaches of success and failure of adopting these technologies:  User decision-making, satisfaction, flow, immersion User value, efficiency and operative benefits	 Human resource development, e.g. learning, training, education tutorials, personnel motivation Sales, marketing and e-commerce applications Wellness and the experience economy Usability, user experience and user interface development Content creation methodologies, tools and approaches, e.g. capturing and recording reality (laser scanning, photogrammetry, using drones), animation and modelling, motion tracking, and utilizing artificial intelligence in modelling and interactions  The topic in earlier HICSS conferences and marketing plan The topic has grown significantly over the past four HICSS conferences beginning from the HICSS-49 Keynote Address. One of the aims of the minitrack is to fortify the interdisciplinary angle to the topics at the IS-CS-marketing intersection and gather momentum. We are confident that a good number of submissions will be received from the HICSS community and that the theme will attract new HICSS participants. The chairs will market the minitrack in both IS and marketing research communities as well as among the previous minitrack attendees. The chairs will look into the possibility of creating a special issue around the topic in a suited journal (e.g. in Electronic Commerce Research and Applications). Each of the chair’s university endorses their involvement at HICSS and covers the costs related.

The technological revolution or the  second industrial revolution used electric power to create mass production. Both of these transformed the way people  worked and lived and made people wealthier and more urban. A third industrial revolution, marked by digital technologies,  access and manufacturing, used electronics and information technology to automate production. The fourth industrial  revolution is on the immediate horizon characterized by a fusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between the  physical, digital and biological spheres. Unlike those that preceded, the fourth industrial revolution is evolving at an  exponential pace, disrupting almost every industry on a global landscape, inevitably leading to profound impact on  business, government, health, and people. The rapid pace and demand of an increasingly more digital world necessarily  mandates that analytics will play a key role as we need to make rapid sense of complex and fast changes driven by big,  real-time data. We are moving into an era in which being able to “see” the information in the data will no longer be  optional and sophisticated visualization methods facilitating rapid understanding will be a critical piece of the “competitive  edge”.    Interactive Visual Analytics and Visualization for Decision Making supports human decision making through interaction  with data and statistical and machine learning processes, with applications in a broad range of situations where human  expertise must be brought to bear on problems characterized by massive datasets and data that are uncertain in fact,  relevance, location in space and position in time. Current applications include environmental science and technologies,  natural resources and energy, health and related life sciences, precision medicine, safety and security and business  processes. Submissions are encouraged that extend the areas of use to new analytic tasks in science and technology,  public health, business intelligence, financial analysis, social sciences, and other domains. Particular emphasis will be given  to submissions that use visual analytics for social change discovery, analysis, communication, and focus on mixed initiative  analysis recognizing that human and machine have a distinct division of labor in the problem-solving process. Submissions  may include studies of visual analytics and decision support in the context of an organization (e.g., communication  between analysts and policy-makers), perceptual and cognitive aspects of the analytic task, Interactive Machine Learning,  and collaborative analysis using visual information systems. Additionally, submissions may include understandable,  trustable AI as well as human-guided AI to round out the problem-solving process.   This proposal builds upon our successful HICSS-47, HICSS-48, HICSS-49, HICSS-50, HICSS-51, HICSS-52, HICSS-53 and HICSS- 54 minitracks on visual analytics for decision support and our earlier minitracks on visual analytics, mobile computing, and  digital media at scale. It seeks to define analytical methods and technologies that use interactive visualization to meet  challenges posed by data, platforms, and applications for decision making and risk-based decision making:   •  Visual analytics and visualization in digital economies  •  Visual analytics and visualization in “wicked” problems  •  Visualization in organizational analytics  •  Visualization and analysis of datasets of varying size and complexity from archives and real-time streams  •  Collaborative visual analysis and operational coordination within and across organizations.  •  Interactive and visual risk-based decision making  •  Interactive machine learning methods  •  Managing response time of complex analytical tasks  •  Effective deployment and case studies of success from deployed visualization and analytics experiences  •  Visualization and analytics for data-driven policy making and decision support  •  Issues and challenges in evaluation of visual decision making   •  Mixed-initiative analysis methods for decision making  •  Cognitive and social science aspects of visual decision-making environments  For HICSS 2022, we encourage authors to address these themes from their own research perspectives. Authors are  encouraged to bring the lens of their own background and expertise to focus on the analytics of the data itself and  coordination of multiple levels of analysis, decision-making and operations to the design and evaluation of effective  presentations for stakeholders.    Both algorithmic “data sciences” approaches and human-centered ""visualization"" and “visual analytics” human-computer  interface methods hold great promise for operationalizing massive datasets and streaming data in support of a broad  range of human activities. Applications in basic scientific research, business analytics, digital economies, health sciences,  environmental science and engineering R&D explore the implications of these methods for advancement of knowledge  and strategic planning. Applications in coordination, command and control of complex human activities such as crowd and  traffic management, disaster relief, law enforcement, and national and cyber security add the constraints of real-time  performance and distribution of planning to the challenges faced.   For this minitrack, we invite computational, cognitive, and organizational perspectives on advanced data processing and  interactive visualization across a range of human endeavors. We also invite participation from researchers who are looking  at scaling issues and multiscale issues, whether these scales refer to the time of decision making, the form-factor and  operational constraints of mobile devices, the number of decision makers or the more traditional notion of multiscale  simulation and real-world scales of data. We are particularly interested in approaches that combine computational and  interactive analytics in “mixed initiative” or Interactive Machine Learning systems, decision support in the context of an  organization (e.g. communication between analysts and policy-makers), perceptual and cognitive aspects of the analytic  task, and collaborative analysis using visual information systems.   Technical	Description	 There is a substantial need for advances in the ability to address large volumes of disparate data, streams from distributed  locations, rapid (often real-time) response, and visual representations on platforms ranging from mobile to large-scale  displays. Gaining maximum benefit from these datasets also demands novel ways of supporting the judgment of skilled  human decision-makers, such as information visualization, human-information interaction, and studies of individual and  collaborative decision-making and coordination of action. Bridging human understanding and computational analysis is  necessary not only for analysts but for policy-makers and operational personnel, making this a broadly interdisciplinary  effort. Bridging these areas of investigation is key to the success of this minitrack. We believe communication, in the HICSS  setting, will cross-pollinate ideas that will advance the state-of-the-art for this class of problems.   From a computational perspective, the challenges of large-volume data, streaming data, and reduced response time  initially appear to be quite distinct. Upon closer inspection, they are often found to be encountering very similar constraint  issues from different perspectives. Fundamentally all algorithms trade off space, time, data volume, and accuracy. If we  can solve a problem on a desktop today, we will expect to be able to solve it on an iPhone or hand-held device tomorrow.  If we solve it with cluster, cloud, or supercomputing today, we expect to solve it locally, tomorrow. Thus, this minitrack  seeks to bring together those working in areas of massive datasets, streaming data, rapid model construction, across a  range of computational footprints and time constraints.   Marketing	plan	 The minitrack was offered successfully in the Decision Analytics and Service Sciences Track at HICSS-47 through HICSS-54  in 2020, and at HICSS 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 under the Digital Media: Content and Communication Track. In 2016,  2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, we had a very successful tutorial on Visual Analytics that attracted around 60 people as well  as  the  minitrack  having  great  submissions,  attendance  and  interest.  We  conducted  the  minitrack  as  a  series  of  presentations with ample time for discussion on each of the topics. That format allowed for significantly more organic  discussion than a strict presentation format with limited time for questions. We plan to repeat this format again. The  organizers for this minitrack include the director of a US Department of Homeland Security Center of Excellence in Visual  Analytics and a theme leader in the companion Center in Data Sciences. These centers together have over 100 active  researchers in the area covered by this proposed minitrack. We will continue our focus on the cognitive sciences  perspective in interactive visual analytics with Brian Fisher as a co-organizer. The third co-organizer is the Director of  Health Analytics (previously the Director of Visualization) at the largest US open science supercomputing center and an  Associate Professor in Women’s Health at the university medical school and brings a perspective on interactively  visualizing data at scale. Additionally, she has initiated activities at her home institution that research visual analytics  methods for informing social action and change. We will bring this success to HICSS-55 by reaching out to those that have  participated in social action/change at those events. We feel this topic is particularly timely and we will reach out  immediately upon acceptance to allow researchers ample time to submit their work. All organizers are committed to  recruiting participants from their respective organizations and from the larger research community. We will also reach out  to the Interactive machine learning/deep learning community and to the perceptual and cognitive science (e.g. decision  science) communities. We will also work to liaise with our collaborators on European visual analytics and data sciences  initiatives, such as the German-American project on Visual Analytics for Security Applications and the German DFG Priority  Program  “Scalable  Visual  Analytics”.  Together  these  provide  ample  opportunities  to  recruit  reviewers  as  well  as  submissions. We plan to again submit a companion tutorial to provide a hands-on focus. Moreover, we plan to advertise  in the INFORMS list, several EU-based lists, as well as target business and finance research listservs. The organizers have  also marketed a corresponding tutorial that provides more detail on sub-topics of relevance to this minitrack. We will put  in another tutorial proposal for HICSS-55 with particular emphasis on visual analytics informing advancement for society  and positive social change.   Previous	Events	 The minitrack was offered successfully at HICSS-54, HICSS-53 (two sessions), HICSS-52 (two sessions), HICSS-51, HICSS-50,  HICSS-49, and HICSS-48 with over 38 attendees and HICSS-47 with over 25 attendees during the last sessions of the  conference, as well as HICSS 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 under the Digital Media: Content and Communication Track. The  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers has offered a Symposium and later a Conference on Visual Analytics Science  and Technology for six years. The organizers put on a 2014 symposium at the Association for Psychological Science annual  meeting and participated in the 2015 symposia at SPIE Visual Data Analysis and the 2015 iConference. The minitrack chairs  have organized symposia on this topic at the Cognitive Science Society in 2007 and 2010. Individual workshops on the  cognitive science and mathematics of visual analytics were hosted in 2008 by Simon Fraser University and the University  of British Columbia in Vancouver Canada and in 2006 by the University of California at Berkeley in California.  Additionally,  a workshop on visualization and analytics for public policy and decision making was held in 2012. Two successful  workshops on interaction for visual analytics and decision making were held in 2013 in Banff and Dagstuhl, Germany.  Finally, this growth in workshops shows strong evidence for growing interest in this topic in what appears to be a  broadening audience with attendees’ backgrounds ranging from cognitive science, to computer science to those in some  form of decision support systems.

Yet, much of the current  efforts have focused on advancing underlying algorithms and not on decreasing the complexity  of AI systems. AI systems are still “black boxes” that are difficult to comprehend—not only for  developers, but particularly for users and decision-makers (Meske et al. 2020). In addition, the  development and use of AI is associated with many risks and pitfalls like biases in data or  predictions based on spurious correlations (“Clever Hans” phenomena) (Lapuschkin et al.  2019), which eventually may lead to malfunctioning or biased AI and hence technologically  driven discrimination.   This is where research on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) comes in. Also referred to  as “transparent,” “interpretable,” or “understandable AI”, XAI aims to “produce explainable  models, while maintaining a high level of learning performance (prediction accuracy); and  enable human users to understand, appropriately, trust, and effectively manage the emerging  generation  of  artificially  intelligent  partners”  (DARPA  2017).  XAI  hence  refers  to  “the  movement, initiatives, and efforts made in response to AI transparency and trust concerns, more  than to a formal technical concept” (Adadi and Berrada 2018, p. 52140). XAI is designed user- centric in that users are empowered to scrutinize and appropriately trust AI (Förster, Klier,  Kluge and Sigler 2020), eventually impacting task performance of users (Kühl, Lobana and  Meske 2019).  With a focus on decision support, this minitrack aims to explore and extend research on how to  establish explainability of intelligent black box systems—machine learning-based or not. We  especially look for contributions that investigate XAI from either a developer’s or user’s  perspective.

It	is	not	only	provided	by	 technical	 means	 but	 also	 thanks	 to	 business-oriented	 approaches,	 such	 as	 Business	 Process	 Management	(BPM).	BPM	constitutes	a	real	asset	for	enhancing	the	services	of	an	organization	and	 their	coordination,	as	well	as	the	products	that	each	actor	of	a	virtual	network	delivers	to	meet	 clients’	expectations	(citizens,	patients,	etc.).	The	BPM	lifecycle	embraces	several	phases	that	aim	 for	a	continuous	process	improvement,	including	process	discovery	and	modeling,	process	mining	 and	analysis,	process	re-design,	process	enactment	and	monitoring.	 	 Collaborative	organizations	need	ways	to	define	and	provide	support	for	their	inter-organizational	 collaborative	processes,	in	order	to	interact	with	each	other	in	an	easier,	more	secure	and	more	 adequate	way,	ensuring	the	quality	of	the	results	to	the	internal	and	the	external	users.	This	support	 must	 fulfill	 both	 centralized	 and	 decentralized	 scenarios	 depending	 on	 the	 domain	 and	 the	 organizations	involved,	including	the	integration	of	their	existing	software	and	information	systems	 for	the	exchange	of	data	and	the	execution	of	business	functions.	 	 Digital	Government	(traditionally	known	as	e-Government)	focuses	on	value	delivery	to	citizens	 through	information	and	communication	technology	(ICT)	support	for	processes,	activities	and	 resources.	 Digital	 government’s	 collaborative	 processes	 involve	 organizations	 (employees,	 technologies),	partners	(providers,	consumers),	and	users	(citizens,	foreigners),	leading	to	complex	 interactions	within	different	e-Government	models	and	available	technologies.	These	models	offer	 mainly	two	types	of	collaborations:	(i)	closed,	in	which	interactions	between	organizations	are	 explicitly	defined	and	already	agreed	as	collaborative	business	processes;	or	(ii)	open,	in	which	 organizations	offer	capabilities	for	integration,	not	explicitly	agreeing	on	their	processes	but	mostly	 on	the	capabilities	they	provide	or	require	to	participate	in	the	collaboration	(like	payment,	event	 awareness,	security,	process	monitoring	and	analysis,	open	data,	integration	with	social	networks,	 and	prediction).	Moreover,	the deployment of a BPM approach in a sensitive e-Government context  often faces critical barriers, such as change management and a potential discouragement when it  comes to modeling complex organizational behaviors.	 	 Successful	 inter-organizational	 collaborative	 process	 management	 within	 e-Government	 organizations	will	lead	to	better	conceptual	and	technological	integration,	not	only	with	each	other	 but	also	with	citizens	and	users	in	general.	To	this	end,	it	is	necessary	to	devise	new	ways	to	deal	 with	the	complexity	of	e-Government	collaborative	process	definition,	modeling,	mining,	analysis,	 enactment,	monitoring	and	improvement	from	various	dimensions	and	points	of	view	including	 theory,	engineering,	interoperability,	agility,	social	aspects,	etc.	  	 This	mini-track	focuses	on	Digital	Government	and	BPM	with	a	focus	on	collaborative	processes.

Marketing plan for the mini-track    Our marketing plan is mainly based on the different communities we have been involved in for  years now, both in Europe and Latin America.    The Latin American Computing Conference (CLEI) this year in its 47th edition (https://clei2021.cr/)  will be held in virtual format in San José, Costa Rica, is published by IEEE since 2012 and brings  together researchers from all over Latin America, Spain and Portugal (http://www.clei.org/cd2018- 2020/). CLEI is one of the most important computing conference in Latin American, as well as the  CLEI community. Delgado was Uruguay’s representative in the period 2016-2020, general chair of  CLEI 2014 (in Montevideo) and is general program chair of CLEI 2021, and Astudillo was Chile’s  representative until 2016, was general chair of CLEI 2016 (in Valparaíso), and is secretary of CLEI  Executive Committee 2021-2023. Delgado and Astudillo are regular contributors as author and  decision  makers  in  the  CLEI  conference  and  community.  The  CLEI  mailing  lists  allow  CFP  dissemination to most Latin American countries and researches.     It is worth mentioning that Latin America has been betting on digital government improvement, led  by Uruguay as the only Latin American country in the Leading countries in the UN-E-Government  Survey 2018 (https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/en-us/Reports/UN-E-Government-Survey- 2018).

This is particularly important in the view of the growing popularity of the smart city idea, which incorporates ICT to enhance the quality and performance of urban services and spaces. Critics point out that technological development should not be a goal, but a tool to achieve better conditions for everybody, with citizens’ needs and preferences as driving values. The minitrack aim is to understand how new technologies can shape the wellbeing of members of local community and their ability to exercise their “right to the city”, defined by Lefebvre (1968) as freedom to make and remake our community according to principles of democracy, equality, and social justice.   As technologies became an increasingly important aspect of urban life, moderating their negative and developing positive functions are among the main challenges for the near future. We know from numerous studies that new technologies have a huge impact on social life, changing the quality of personal relationships, the concept of proximity, the idea of authority, privacy, liberty, and democracy. ICT will have a growing impact on our lives, our cities, and communities and that a developing virtual interface will distract attention from physical, street-level processes, planning, and placemaking challenges. Along with catalyzing new needs of citizens and transforming the way they are addressed, we observe that ICT influences people’s ability to exercise the “right to the city” on several levels.    Technologies are changing city life in visible and invisible ways. There is a need to start looking closer at possible consequences of technological innovation in all spatial and political interventions, to avoid unintended negative effects as well as to strengthen their positive potential to enable wellbeing and urban democracy.  This minitrack invites research from across disciplines that addresses the changes in the local community that can be understood as the aftermath of the ICT implementation. Particular questions/topics of interest include: How can citizens benefit from novel digital technologies? What do citizens lose from the implementation of digital technologies by the cities?  Which set of values does the digital transformation address/strengthens/threaten? How does the digital transformation impact and change the citizens’ right to the city? How is the digital transformation process managed over time and by whom? How ICT can strengthen/weaken the street-level processes and placemaking challenges?

It is important for researchers to continue to move systems closer to guarantees of security, but it is also essential to create techniques to adaptively defend against an attacker who circumvents the current security or has insider knowledge of system properties or security practices. Deception for cyber defense works towards that goal—to rebalance the asymmetric nature of computer defense by increasing attacker workload and risk while decreasing that of the defender.  Cyber deception is one defensive technique that considers the human component of a cyber attack. Deception holds promise as a successful tactic for making an attacker’s job harder because it does more than just block access: it can also cause the attacker to waste both time and effort. Moreover, deception can be used by a defender to impart an incorrect belief in the attacker, the effects of which can go beyond any static defense. Understanding the human cognition and behavior of both the cyber defender and cyber attacker is a critical component of cybersecurity. Cyberpsychology research advances the science of human behavior and decision making in cyberspace to understand, anticipate, and influence attacker behavior. It also seeks to ensure scientific rigor and quantify the effectiveness of our defensive methods. In the cyber world, an attacker only knows what is perceived through observation of the target network. The intruder is often thousands of miles away from the network to which he or she is attempting to gain entry. Unfortunately, modern networks and systems often unintentionally provide more information to an attacker than defenders would like. However, the network owner also has the opportunity to reveal information he or she desires the attacker to know—including deceptive information. Because network information is often complex and incomplete, it provides a natural environment in which to embed deception since, in chaos, there is opportunity. Deception can alter the mindset, confidence, and decision-making process of an attacker, which can have more significant effects than traditional defenses. Furthermore, using deception for defensive purposes gives the defender at least partial control of what an attacker knows, which can provide opportunities for strategic interaction with an attacker.  Authorized users of systems and networks, or masqueraders of these users, may act as attackers. These insiders can leak sensitive information deliberately or accidentally. Detecting and thwarting these attacks is more difficult than dealing with external attackers because the users are often authorized to access the information they leak, or the systems and networks the data is on. As a defensive technique, deception in this context must take into account the psychology of the attacker and the organizational, political, and societal environments in which the attack occurs. These research efforts require an interdisciplinary approach and the mini-track is soliciting papers across multiple disciplines. It is essential to understand attacker and defender cognition and behavior to effectively and strategically induce cognitive biases and increase cognitive load, making our systems more difficult to attack.   Topics of interest include (but are not limited to): Science of Deception (e.g., evaluation techniques, deception frameworks applied to cyber); Practice of Cyber Deception (e.g., case studies, deception technology, deception detection); Understanding/influencing the cyber adversary (e.g., adversary emulation, measures of effectiveness); Psychological and social-cultural adversarial mental models that can be used to estimate and predict adversarial mental states and decision processes; Cognitive Modeling of cyber tasks; Adversary observation/learning schemes through both active multi-level “honey bait” systems and passive watching, in conjunction with active learning and reasoning to deal with partial information and uncertainties; Oppositional Human Factors to induce cognitive biases and increase cognitive load for cyber attackers; Metrics for quantifying deception effectiveness in driving adversary mental state and in determining optimized deception information composition and projection; Experimental Design, approaches, and results; Theoretical formulation for a one-shot or multiple rounds of attacker/defender interaction models; Identification of social/cultural factors in mental state estimation and decision manipulation process; Cyber maneuver and adaptive defenses; Cyber defense teaming; Protecting our autonomous systems from being deceived; Policy hurdles, solutions, and case studies in adoption of cyber deception technologies; Predicting, understanding and protecting against insider threats; Analyzing the effects of insider attacks; Human factors and the insider threat problem; Examining the causes of an insider threat from a behavioral science perspective; and Measuring the effectiveness of mitigation technologies and methodologies.    Justification Before the Cyber Deception for Defense minitrack at HICSS-53, there was no existing academic conference with proceedings that specifically calls for papers on cyber deception. The proposed program chairs each had previously organized their own independent workshop on cyber deception and are well known in that community. A number of notable experts from academia, industry, government, and funding agencies regularly attend these events. The cyber deception community needs to join with a conference to have one repeating location where researchers can gather to share and discuss results. The outcome of the first mintrack was as expected, with a record-breaking number of submissions for an inaugural minitrack and receipt of the best paper award. HICSS continues to be a good candidate because its multi-disciplinary nature aligns with broad range of disciplines that perform research in cyber deception.  Marketing Plan The co-chairs have a number of approaches to encourage participation in this proposed mini-track. This relies on our extensive, international-level networks to encourage Participation and submissions from our academic, government, and industry contacts. In addition to the participant list from our independent cyber deception workshop run in past years, we can further leverage our specific knowledge of researchers and sponsors of research specifically focused on cyber deception.  Supporting information: Dr. Ferguson-Walter and Dr. Fugate are founding members of a new cybersecurity technical group at the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society (HFES) and can send email solicitations to the mailing list, as well as post fliers and spread the word at the annual conference. Dr. Ferguson-Walter has hosted two Cyber Deception Workshops focused on government agencies, national labs and other partners working on cyber deception and has started a Community of Interest (COI) on cyber deception which can be used to advertise related conferences and call for papers. Dr. Ferguson-Walter recently hosted an International Workshop on Autonomous Cyber Operations, and has had extensive experience gathering participation and talks for research events. Dr. Fugate recently hosted Cyber Shorelines which focused on government and industry research and practitioners focused on cyber deception, counter-deception, and adversarial machine learning. He has an email list of researchers and technologist interested in future events on these topics. Dr. Fugate has extensive connections within the Navy, including the Naval Academies.

Information Technology has become pervasive in all aspects of our lives. The minitrack examines aspects associated with the security of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) used by governments and critical infrastructures and explores ways that IT can enhance the ability of governments to ensure the safety and security of its citizens.  Of especial interest are systems such as industrial control systems, SCADA, and process control networks which control infrastructures that include electricity (Smartgrid), pipelines, chemical plants, manufacturing, traffic control and more.   Governments have also embraced IT to interface with citizens in a more efficient manner. Security issues have risen to the forefront as a result of data disclosures and identity theft incidents discussed in mainstream media. Other issues include intellectual property theft and criminal acts involving computers. Recently, the issue of cybersecurity information sharing has also risen in importance and much has been written and debated on this subject.   This mintrack explores research into pressing issues surrounding the intersection of cybersecurity and government spheres of influence. Whether technical or policy, from information sharing to new analytical methods of detection of insider threats, this minitrack casts a wide net to bring cross disciplinary thinking to problems with far-reaching implications.   This is a wide focus minitrack, if your research involves security associated with IT or OT, and has a government component, then this is its home. Topics include, but are not limited to:  Systems for governments to respond to security events  Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP)  Cyber physical systems security  Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and control systems  Election Security Cybersecurity issues during a crisis such as a pandemic Information assurance and trusted Computing  Information sharing  Information security economics  Information warfare  Incident response  New threats, including insider and nation states  Digital forensics  Privacy and freedom of information  Security management  Laws and regulation of IT security  Security concerns of new technologies  Cybersecurity in government disaster recovery and business continuity  Case reports related to security experiences within government   Marketing Plan  	This minitrack has been successfully operating for over a decade.  During that time we have built up a group of researchers who regularly attend as well as regularly submit publications for consideration.  The Minitrack chairs have built up a list of individuals who we send information to on the conference who we also ask to share with their colleagues.  We also send information on the conference and the mini-track to departments in academic institutions that have security programs.  Additionally, when conferences were attended in person, flyers were taken to other conferences to advertise the HICSS conference and the call for proposals.  Minitrack Co-Chairs:  Gregory B.

Disaster	Information,	Resilience,	for	Emergency	and	Crisis	Technologies.	             Frederick Benaben  Julie Dugdale  Andrea Tapia  Mihoko Sakurai  Elsa Negre  Overview	 The 21st century has been termed “the century of disasters.” (Jan Egeland, former United Nations  Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, February 2011).  Worldwide there were twice as many disasters and catastrophes in the first decade of this century as  in the last decade of the 20th century. All continents are affected, both directly and indirectly.  Unfortunately, the trend continues, fuelled by climate change, demographic changes and the unsettled  political scene: The last events regarding COVID-19 strongly and unfortunately support that trend.  The serious challenges facing government in cities, regions and nations of the world relate to acute  shocks (such as forest fires, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, pandemics and terrorist attacks) and  chronic  stresses  (such  as  high  unemployment,  religious  extremism,  inefficient  public  transport  systems, endemic violence, chronic shortages of food and water). Information is among the key life- supporting essentials in a disaster response, as well as water and basic foods which are vital to sustain  lives. Above all, the recent pandemics have shown how information (about contamination, about  stocks, about science and progress) could be at the heart of the crisis management.  Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has, and will continue to profoundly change,  disaster management in years to come. This, coupled with the impressive recent advances in artificial  intelligence, offers huge potential for better management of crisis situations.  Data and information management also guides us to build a disaster-resilient community which can  adapt the society to those unexpected events. These issues should be tackled at each level of the  governance (international, national, regional, local, etc.), and with regards to all relevant dimensions  (social, technological, interoperability, agility, etc.).  We invite papers that deal with any aspect of the analysis, design, development, deployment,  implementation, integration, operation, use or evaluation of ICT for disaster responses, disaster  information management, and resilient communities, including discussing government roles. Papers  may address any phase in the disaster management cycle: Prevention and mitigation; preparedness;  alert; response; recovery; and post disaster. In addition, we support innovative and break-through  visions regarding “disaster information, technology and resilience”        MT CfP for HICSS-55, 2022  Topics	of	Interests	 •  Government’s disaster preparedness – disaster management plan, business continuity plan for  technology use  •  Disaster  information  management  for  all  stages  of  disaster –  preparedness,  mitigation,  response and recovery  •  Early warning systems and situational awareness among key stakeholders  •  Social media and Citizen/Volunteers engagement to disaster responses  •  Artificial Intelligence (AI) based content management, disaster mapping and Crisis informatics  •  Real-time data analysis for government’s decision making  •  Vertical management of information (from very local to the highest governmental level)  •  International disaster response collaborations including government organizations  •  Disaster communications with government organizations  •  Disaster data recovery regarding public information  •  Functional and technological expectations for disaster management inside governmental  organizations  •  Government’s role in resilient communities  •  Human Centered Sensing for collaboration and communication  •  Privacy, security and ethical issues in crisis and emergency management  •  Pattern recognition, triage and prioritization of assistance  •  Case studies; theory and practice  •  Advances in crisis management methods and practice  •  Security and safety models for emergency management systems  •  eHealth for disasters and emergencies  •  Drones for disaster response and management and Disaster robotics  •  Computational simulation of crisis or emergency situations, including agent based modeling  and social simulation  •  Mobile ad-hoc networks for emergencies  •  Ground security / homeland security  •  Antifragility of systems and territories  •  Decision making in uncertain and instable environments  •  Standardization and interoperability issues in disaster management from an eGov perspective  •  Resilience of socio-technic systems, critical infrastructure and network of infrastructures  •  Emerging paradigms for disaster management  •  Simulation and disaster management  •  Disinformation, misinformation, and fake news in (social) media and institutions    	       MT CfP for HICSS-55, 2022  Co-Chairs	 Dr. Frederick Benaben (Primary Contact) - Email: frederick.benaben@mines-albi.fr   Professor  Centre Génie Industriel, IMT Mines Albi  Campus Jarlard – Route de Teillet  81000 Albi, France  Dr. Julie Dugdale (Primary Contact) - Email: Julie.Dugdale@imag.fr   Associate Professor  STEAMER (Spatio-temporal information, adaptability, multimedia and knowledge representation)  Team, Grenoble Informatics Laboratory    IMAG Building, 700 avenue Centrale  Domaine Universitaire - 38401 St Martin d'Hères, France  Dr. Andrea Tapia - Email: atapia@ist.psu.edu   Professor  Information Science and Technology, Pennsylvania State University  Westgate Building, University Park  PA 16802, USA  Dr. Elsa Negre - Email: elsa.negre@dauphine.fr   Associate Professor  LAMSADE, UMR CNRS 7243, Paris-Dauphine University  Place du Maréchal de Lattre de Tassigny  75016 Paris, France  Dr. Mihoko Sakurai - Email: msakurai@glocom.ac.jp   Associate Professor  Center for Global Communications, International University of Japan  6-15-21 Roppongi, Minato-ku, Tokyo 106-0032    Frederick Benaben is a full Professor in Artificial Intelligence for Crisis Management at IMT Mines Albi,  France, Adjunct Professor at ISyE Georgia Tech, USA, Adjunct Professor at SEM Beijing JiaoTong  University, China.

On the other hand, the increased digitalization of society and exponential  technological developments have made participation in governance more technologically feasible than ever.  Research and practice have sprung to investigate how emerging technologies could impact engagement in  governance under such umbrellas as e-democracy (16), e-participation (21, 25), e-voting (26), e-petitioning (3),  and online, participatory campaigning (11, 31), amongst many other governance engagement strategies.     Engagement with governance is often facilitated through various technological means and strategies. Among  others, games, game-based and playful approaches (10, 22, 23) have been utilized in governance and public  engagement practices, for example through simulations and policy games (10). Emerging and connected  technologies and strategies are similarly being utilized to foster engagement with governance  through social  media (2, 8), gamification & gameful design (12, 13, 18, 19), serious games (7, 32), persuasive technology (24),  virtual (28) and augmented reality (4, 27). For example: serious games are being utilized to foster civic learning  (9), gamification to promote formal interaction between citizens and policy makers (10, 13, 15), and virtual reality  as means of promoting empathy, integration and social connection (5). Many have, additionally, explored how  public spaces, and especially smart cities, could be made more engaging to citizens, often in playful ways (14,  23). Smart cities can become playgrounds, where inhabitants, for better or for worse, shape the city’s landscape:  its public areas, walkways, social interactions and makeups through technologies (8, 14, 20, 23, 30). Location- based games such as Pokémon Go (4) were able to attract millions of players, making cities friendlier as spaces  where individuals felt safer and were more likely to create social connections with their neighbors. Concepts such  as Hackable Cities (20, 34), Playable Cities (23), and Urban Gamification (33) highlight the large-scale change  that emerging technologies are bringing about in the smart cities of the future. Moreover, social media and user  generated content have become a key player in public life through, for example, political memes (2, 8, 11), and  organization of political and city activities (20).     These emerging technologies and engagement strategies, amongst others, have shown and still hold a great  potential for public engagement in governance. Nonetheless, engagement with governance and the public good  can be seen to exist outside the common hurdles of the everyday life, where the effects of engagement are often  invisible or take a long time to materialize (13, 18). While we could argue that the basic technological means for  facilitating engagement in governance are available to remedy to the modern physical challenges that hinder  exactly such engagement, public engagement with governance often swings between the extremes of being  passive or active through logistically unsustainable online and offline movements engagement, such as has been  seen with the Arab Spring (1, 17), occupy Wall Street movements (6), and some city alteration movements (20,  29, 34). Both, the lack of engagement in governance and unsustainable engagement with it are of detriment to  governance and democratic practices.     We encourage a wide range of submissions from any disciplinary backgrounds: empirical and conceptual research  papers, case studies, and reviews that investigate emerging engagement technologies & strategies and how they  both positively, and negatively impact engagement with cities and governance.    Authors of accepted papers have the option to fast-track extended versions of their HICSS  papers to Internet  Research (Impact factor 3.838) or AIS Transactions on Human-Computer Interaction.

Through social media, mobile applications, online services, and other forms of digital services, governments are increasingly expecting that individuals will interact with them through a range of digital media and technologies.  This includes public policy-making (e.g., governance), government operations (e.g. emergency management), citizen engagement (e.g. transparency), and government services (e.g., information provision). As they promote these digital pathways, it is critical for governments to ensure that all citizens are able to realize their needs through inclusive design, availability, and ability. However, many digital divides remain – from access to sufficient technologies (e.g., broadband, devices, costs), the ability to use technologies, and the design of digital government services.  This minitrack hopes to increase the attention on digital inclusion within electronic government services. The minitrack includes (but is not limited to) topics such as: This includes, but is not limited to: Longitudinal analyses of inclusion in digital government; The role of digital literacy in use/non-use of online government services; The use of digital government by immigrant and migrant populations; The use of digital government by indigenous populations; The use of digital government by low-literacy populations; The role of socio-economic status on the use of digital government; Accessibility of digital government for people with perceptual, motor, or cognitive disabilities; The role of government in the development of international technical standards for digital accessibility; The role of community-based organizations (e.g., public libraries, non-government organizations) in fostering digital inclusion;  Development and/or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies related to digital inclusion; Trends in case law related to digital inclusion; Trends in comparative or international law related to digital inclusion; The relationship between trust of institutions and use of digital government by diverse populations; How digital-based voting impacts involvement of citizens in elections LGBTQ interactions with digital government; Usability evaluation methods for testing digital government services with diverse user populations; Research methods for understanding why diverse individuals avoid using digital government; and, Inclusive design methods to involve diverse populations in the actual development of digital government.  Marketing plan: If the proposed mini-track is accepted, we plan to market it to multiple communities to which we belong, including: electronic government, human-computer interaction, accessibility, disability rights law, information policy, library science, and ICT4D. The CFP will be posted on websites, listservers, and social media.

Specifically, this track seeks papers that discuss theories and/or present cases useful to better understand how different e-government policies and or strategies can lead to successful e-government deployments or, on the other hand, to the factors which may lead to failure of such projects. Papers which examine or discuss external or contextual factors that affect or influence digital government, such as the political state; organizational culture; institutional factors or normative arrangements are also invited. By digital government action, we mean both macro-level institutional designs and micro-level collaboration and competition between diverse stakeholders.  While there is already a modest body of literature on best practice for e-government deployments, there are significant gaps in this existing literature and new and emerging technologies, not to mention new thinking about public administration and government itself, often demand new ways of thinking and innovative approaches to frame these deployments. Due to the current pandemic, these new demands become increasingly important as digital technologies provide new opportunities and challenges for adaptive and agile governance. Papers which address these challenges are particularly welcome this year. In addition, the minitrack welcomes contributions exploring the issues associated with the design and implementation of policies and strategies that change the nature of the interactions between government and citizens, private sector organizations, and NGOs. Moreover, papers that discuss the political, institutional and organisational implication of the deployment of emerging and disruptive technologies are particularly welcomed.  We invite papers on the following topics, but not limited to:  Cases of e-government platforms design, implementation and management Best practices for digital governance using innovative practices National and global digital strategies to respond to a pandemic  ICT mediated co-creation and co-production E-Participation and E-democracy policies and strategies E-Procurement policies and strategies ICT related outsourcing in the public sector Public policy issues in digital government ICT for development strategies Digital innovation strategies for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals  ICT, transparency and accountability ICT for efficiency and effectiveness in government action Interoperability policies: legal, organizational, semantic, and technical layers Legal and judicial transformation associated with ICTs deployments E-justice and ethics of artificial intelligence  Privacy and data protection policies and strategies Public health versus privacy concerns  AI policies and strategies Socio-political, institutional, organisational and ethical impacts of disruptive technologies Strategies to manage deployment of innovative technologies Digital by default and its implications Lessons for digital policy from the pandemic of 2019-2020.  We are looking for high-quality conference papers that adopt a wide range of approaches on content, case studies, or practical and theoretical models to advance the knowledge related to the design, implementation, and management of strategies on policies in the e-government context. The papers submitted to this minitrack must be new and unpublished.

This  transformation, which has become a top priority for many city and other local governments,  offers great promise for improved well-being and prosperity but, also, poses significant  challenges at the complex intersection of technology and society.     A  smart  and  connected  community  can  be  conceptualized  as  one  that  synergistically  integrates  intelligent  technologies  with  the  natural  and  built  environments,  including  infrastructure, to improve the social, economic, and environmental well-being of those who  live,  work,  or  travel  within  it.  Building  on the  notion  of  community informatics,  smart  communities can be seen as enabling and empowering citizens and supporting the individual  and communal quests for well-being.    Although the literature is rich in references to smart cities and communities, this is still a  developing and fuzzy concept that is not used consistently. Despite the different definitions  and studies, there seems to be agreement on the fact that smart cities and communities is a  multidimensional and multifaceted concept that goes beyond the mere use of technology  and infrastructure. Although technology is a necessary condition to become smart, it is not  the only one. City administration and community management, information integration,  data quality, privacy and security, institutional arrangements, and citizen participation are  just some of the issues that need greater attention to make a community smarter today and  in the near future. The literature on smart cities and communities is fragmented, particularly  in terms of the strategies that different cities and communities should follow in order to  become smarter. What most of the literature does agree on is that there is no one route to  becoming smart and different communities have adopted different approaches that reflect  their particular circumstances.     This mini track aims at exploring these issues, paying particular attention to the challenges of  smart cities and smart communities as well as to the impact of these initiatives. It also  focuses on the orchestrated interplay and balance of smart governance practices, smart  public administration, smart communities, smart resources and talent leverage in urban,  rural, and regional spaces facilitated by novel uses of ICT and other technologies.    As a result, areas of focus and interest to this mini-track include, but are not limited, to the  following topics:  -  Taxonomies of smart cities and communities   -  Smart governance as the foundation to creating smart urban and regional spaces  (elements, prerequisites, and principles of smart governance)  -  Smart government (focal areas, current practices, cases, and potential pitfalls)  -  Smart partnerships (triple/quadruple helix, public-private partnerships, and citizen  participation)  -  Smart cities, communities and regions (cases, rankings, comparisons, and critical  success factors)  -  Collective intelligence for smart cities and communities  -  Emerging technologies in smart cities and communities (artificial intelligence, big  data, open data, social media and networks, etc)  -  Management of smart cities and communities  -  Outcomes of smart cities and communities  -  Smart services  -  Urban-rural gaps in smart communities  -  Resilience capacity in smart cities and communities.             Marketing plan    All e-government’s mini tracks call for papers are posted on the e-government track chair’s  webpage. Additionally, the call for papers will be posted on several websites (such our  organizations’). We will also send the call for papers to several e-government networks, send  personal invitations to colleagues, and will use social media to disseminate it (in particular,  Twitter and LinkedIn).

Additionally, their stakeholders are more and more intensely digitalized and interconnected, increasing potential risks but also revealing new opportunities at anytime and anywhere. In such a context, managers, public and governemental authorities must rethink their decision support systems to remain competitive and sustainable globally. In all domains, and particularly in public area, Digital and Hyperconnected SCSs will soon be the new normal. Collaborative networked systems such as public SCSs should be opportunity-oriented to build agreements on-the-fly and get exceptional results. Such systems are bound to gradually move from being driven by long-term strategic alliances, as it systematically exists in public sector, to being opportunity-driven goal-oriented networks. More recently, authors showed that these systems are more and more intensely interconnected on multiple layers, ultimately anytime and anywhere. The interconnectivity layers notably include digital, physical, operational, business, legal and personal layers. This new state is notably called “hyperconnectivity” in the “Physical Internet” framework. Such a state implies numerous new opportunities for managers, public and governemental authorities, particularly regarding the possibility for SCSs to become more flexible, dynamically driven and open instead of rigid, planned with static policies and dedicated. This allows considering a set of partners and infrastructures not limited to the known and active ones, opening avenues and degrees of freedom when aiming to catch opportunities on the fly as they occur. One of the serious challenges facing governments of the world relate to develop resilient, sustainable and efficient SCSs. Unfortunately, to date, very few practices and research works support this ambition. Consequently, managers, public and governemental authorities are looking for innovative systems and associated decision support systems designed to engineer, improve and manage their activities in this new typical environment. This minitrack features digitalized and hyperconnected SCS engineering and management, especially in public context, participating in the development of a more efficient, resilient and sustainable society. These issues should be tackled at each level of the governance. We invite papers that deal with any aspect of the analysis, design, development, deployment, implementation, integration, improvement, use or evaluation of SCSs, particularly in public sector, in a highly digitalized and/or interconnected context. Besides, we support innovative and break-through visions regarding digitalization and hyperconnectivity capabilities and their applications.

The Digital Government Reference Library contains more than 13,500 peer-reviewed publications, marking am 8% increases in references from December 2019. This multi-disciplinary study domain benefits from researchers and practitioners from diverse fields, including but not limited to public administration, information systems, information science, and political science. As the domain matures, it is useful for scholars and other stakeholders to examine the state of the body of knowledge. To this end, several key questions emerge: Given the applied nature of digital government, what is the role of theory? What are the fundamental theoretical contributions to or from the digital government discipline, if any? Does the field have any foundational theoretic frameworks? Given its interdisciplinary nature, does the field need to develop its own set of theories? What is the appropriate balance of theory and practice in this domain of study? What are the reference disciplines for digital government, if any? Does digital government have, or shall digital government have, a “home” (anchor) discipline? Is digital government (can, or shall, it evolve into) its own discipline? What relevance does the digital government body of knowledge have to practice? The purpose of this mini-track is to explore the role of theory development in this applied discipline. We welcome submissions with diverse views on the role of theory development in digital government to promote critical discussion of the current status and future trajectory of the discipline. Potential topics include: Fundamental Digital Government Theories The Future of Digital Government Research Digital Government Theory Development The Role of Theory Development and Theory Integration in Digital Government The Status of the Digital Government Domain (discipline, or not?)

As digital inequalities are on the rise globally, the current global pandemic makes understanding the internet and the related myriad divides, as well as increased reliance on digital technologies and social networking platforms more vital than ever. Recognizing the kaleidoscope and intersectionality of culture, gender and identity, this minitrack presents innovative research across a wide range of methods and subjects. Exploring how social media technologies become interconnected with and embedded in existing socio-cultural contexts is essential to assess how these platforms affect key power dynamics in society. This minitrack sets the scene for analyzing better how digital and social media can foster (or serve as hindering factors for) diversity and inclusion in multiple settings, especially in a world coping with renewed calls for social justice and a pandemic likely to have long-term impacts. In sum, this minitrack highlights findings from a range of disciplines and methodologies that focus on the three I’s of internet, identity, and inclusion as they intersect with transformational social media and perhaps now more than ever impact human lives.  Potential Minitrack Topics and Themes:  The pandemic & roles of social media in inclusion and/or exclusion Inter-cultural and Cross-cultural use of Social Media Crowdsourcing Processes and Inclusion Issues Designing Social Media for Inclusion Social media, identity and collective action Gendered Social Media The construction and circulation of gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, religion and disability through the use of social media Online Harassment Identity Enactment, Adoption, and Policing Reproduction of biases Governance and Rules in Action Aging and Social Media Inter-generational use of Social Media Impact and influence of social media on diversity Social Media, Inclusion, and Inclusivity Social Media & Implicit Bias Social Media, Culture & Change/Social Innovation Social Media & Intersectionality Social media, Access and Virtual Learning Social media, accessibility and digital disability Social Media, Disruptive Innovation, and Capacity-Building for All  Marketing Plan: This minitrack has seen an increase in both number and quality of submissions, since its creation. The January 2021 online HICSS 54 venue actually attracted scholars from around the world who had not before participated in a HICSS meeting, thus raising both U.S. and international awareness. Our virtual minitrack session included participants from countries as diverse as the U.S., Poland, Israel, Iran, and China. The Minitrack chairs intend to activate this informal network to spread widely the call for submissions and information about our track and HICSS 55. Additionally, we plan to target scholars from HBCU and HACU institutions as well as scholars presenting on topics related to this minitrack’s research agenda at other professional meetings.  We also plan to target colleagues in higher education institutions in the ASEAN region and in other world regions through already established Minitrack chairs’ networks. Using social media (including Twitter and Facebook), of course, to highlight the call for submissions, we also intend to use Spring online professional and scholarly meetings (and related listservs) as venues for sharing the call for papers. Finally, we hope to have a specific fast track journal opportunity by the time we announce the call, pending approval of the renewal of this minitrack.   Finally, we wish to express our appreciation to Kevin Crowston and Karine Nahon who co-chaired the Digital and Social Media Track as well as Tung Bui’s leadership of HICSS at the time Nanette Levinson informally presented the idea for the initial version of this minitrack. At the time, the Minitrack’s focus may have been seen by some as peripheral.

It is also changing the way we access and consume media, stay in touch with family and friends, as well as how we communicate in our online communities. We also recognize that far-reaching conversations can be manipulated through social media. For example, political and social polarization are being exacerbated by online echo chambers. One of the things these phenomena have in common is that they generate a tremendous volume of data that can be analyzed and mined for both research and commercial purposes. This minitrack focuses on research that brings together digital and social media and data analytics, data mining & machine learning.

There has been an explosion of research using social media data to study human behavior and  social interaction in almost every domain of social science. While the body of literature using  digital and social media data is growing at a staggering rate, accompanying methodological  contributions about the process of conducting research with digital and social media data  remains thin. The existing methodological literature is typically tool or technology driven, and not  a result of empirical examination of the data collection process.This leaves researchers without  an understanding of how to approach or evaluate the social media data collection process, and  in turn, how to appropriately interpret findings from this type of research. As a result,  researchers, practitioners, and students are left to continually reinvent the wheel by learning  through a process of trial and error.    This minitrack addresses this gap by providing a venue to discuss methodological issues and  approaches to conducting research with digital and social media data. We welcome papers  related to methodological challenges for researchers including, but not limited to: (1) the need  for new methods for data collection and analysis, (2) adaptations of existing methods (3) issues  of representation and sampling, (4) ephemerality of social media and digital trace data, (5)  holistic collection of digital social media data and associated content such as  images/URLs/video, (6) preservation, archiving, and data sharing, and (7) impact of changing  platform affordances, interfaces, designs, and APIs.    Journals for fast track opportunities, if any    We are currently in discussion with the editors of Internet Histories for consideration of fast track  opportunities.    Marketing plan    In addition to our personal networks, we will market the track to researchers via mailing lists and  social media sites for the Association of Internet Researchers, SOCNET, EASA Media  Anthropology Network, CHI, CWCW, ASA, HASTAC, and the International Communication  Association (Communication and Technology Division and Computational Methods Interest  Group).    Name, affiliation, and contact information of minitrack chair (primary contact) and  co-chair(s)  Each minitrack can only have a maximum of 4 minitrack chairs.

Digital and social media (DSM) have transformed the workplace in organizations. Two decades  ago, electronic communication changed organizational forms, enabled electronic document  management, and preserved organizational memory. During the past two decades, the growth  of digital and social media technologies has impacted organizations in new ways. Social media  includes blogs, wikis, social networking sites, and microblogging that provide new affordances  to its users.  While some prior studies have provided evidence to show the positive impacts of  enterprise social media on employees, work processes and performance, other studies have  uncovered negative effects of DSM use on employee productivity and behaviors. Since spring  2020, the global outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has increased social media  use in home offices when companies sent employees to work from home to contain the spread  of the deadly virus. In order for an organization to amplify the returns or benefits and to  mitigate the drawbacks of their DSM use, it is imperative for both researchers and practitioners  to deepen their understanding of the implications of DSM use for organizational purposes.     This mini-track focuses on the internal and external organizational use of digital and social  media to facilitate work processes (e.g., communication, collaboration and socialization)  inclusive of both business (for-profit) and non-profit organizations. Hence, research of this mini- track lies at the intersection of multiple disciplines, namely Science & Technology, Organization  Science, Marketing, and Behavioral Science.     The Call for Papers welcomes theoretical and empirical studies addressing organizational,  managerial, technical, and behavioral perspectives on digital and social media by enterprises  and their employees.  Potential issues and topics include, but are not limited to:  •  Digital and social media affordances  •  Digitization of work and its impact on work processes  •  Dark side of enterprise social media   •  Digital and social media use & employee work-life balance   •  Digital and social media use & Information security  •  Enterprise social media use during the COVID-19 pandemic  •  Effects (both positive and negative) of digital and social media at workplace  •  Methodologies for studying digital and social media in enterprise   •  Organizational management practices associated with digital and social media use  1      •  New theories to describe and explain the phenomenon of using digital and social media  in workplace  •  Roles and responsibilities of IS departments in the use of and support for digital and  social media  •  The use of social media & fundraising or donations  •  The use of social media & public perception management  •  The use of social media & enterprise strategy    [2] Marketing Plan.     Over the past seven years, this mini-track has made a steady progress in attracting quality  submissions. All the three co-chairs of the mini-track have research expertise in research topics  covered in the proposed mini-track. In addition, all the three co-chairs have served as track co- chairs and mini-track co-chairs at various academic conferences, including HICSS and AMCIS. Our  detailed marketing plan includes:  •  Publish the mini-track call for paper to the established community of the 8-year-old mini- track.  •  Market this mini-track at AMCIS, ACM SIGMIS and OCIS division of AOM Annual Meeting.  •  Explore options to edit a special issue of Information and Organization, where the best  papers from this track will be fast-tracked.

"HICSS-54","DSM","Digital and Social Media","b3783a18-951f-4cff-a850-d64d24d42363","Games and Gaming","Games & Gaming Mini-track Proposal Digital and Social Media Track February, 2021 For HICSS 55, January 2022  Kelly Bergstrom, Kishonna Gray, and Nathaniel Poor, co-chairs  	We are proposing, for the sixth year, to run the Games & Gaming mini-track within the Digital and Social Media track for HICSS 55. Nathaniel Poor, Kelly Bergstrom, and Kishonna Gray are returning as mini-track chairs.  Proposal 	Games, gaming, and playful behavior have been an essential element in our history and culture. Games and gaming often have a social dimension, with digital media in particular moderating those activities in unique ways. People love games, and our sessions have been well-attended at the recent HICSS conferences. As such, we propose that the Games & Gaming mini-track continue to focus on digital gaming and its many social aspects. 	Adhering to our so-far successful process, we are looking for work related to digital games and sociality. Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods papers are welcome, ranging from interviews to big data analyses, or more broadly theoretical papers looking at digital gaming practices in general. Types of games studied may include massively multiplayer online games; PC, console, and mobile; free to play and “pay to play”; and games from small independent producers as well as giant game studios. As part of the Digital and Social Media track, we expect papers to contain a social dimension, examining, for example, sociability, social practices, communities, use of social affordances, or some other social dimension. Recently, researchers and the papers in our mini-track have focused on esports and video game streaming, both of which have a wider social dimension, and, based on session attendance, gather wide interest from the HICSS community.  Submission History  Contextualizing Academic Work on Games Journals and conferences that involve games research 	Games and gaming have been a focus of academic inquiry for some time, with outlets in both conferences and journals. Not all of this work is social, but a fair amount is. Several conferences have games as a primary focus including FDG (Foundation of Digital Games), DiGRA (Digital Games Research Association) and Meaningful Play. CHI, the giant of the HCI world (an ACM conference), has spun off gaming into CHI Play, its own separate conference held at a different time of the year from CHI, although CHI itself still accepts games papers. ICA (the International Communication Association) has a gaming division which has been around for over ten years, and NCA (the National Communication Association) added a gaming division a few years ago. Both AoIR (Association of Internet Researchers) and PCA/ACA (Pop Culture Association / American Culture Association) include games research as part of their annual conference programming. Other conferences, such as CSCW (Computer Supported Collaborative Work, which is also an ACM conference like CHI) on occasion have gaming-focused sessions. 	Several journals focus primarily on games, such as Games & Culture, Game Studies, The Journal of Virtual Worlds Research and The Journal of Gaming & Virtual Worlds; others frequently publish research focused on games, such as New Media & Society, The Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, The International Journal of Communication, and Information, Communication & Society.   Uniqueness of the G&G mini-track within HICSS 	The Games & Gaming mini-track of HICSS provides researchers with an opportunity to present work on social aspects of digital games. The uniqueness of this mini-track is its unabashed focus on games and gaming, acknowledging that games can provide unusual and challenging analytical issues not found in other environments that may not have the same playful, perhaps semi-anonymous, focus on a game. Games research may call for multi-site, multi-method analysis not always found in other research areas and not only calls for deep understanding of theory and method but of games, gaming, and specific gaming environments. Given that G&G focuses on social elements, interactions, and structures, we envision digital games as socio-technical constructs. 	We are not interested in gamification or simulation of or for business processes, but may accept appropriate papers focused on simulations or the social aspects of gamification if they have a digital dimension to the work. We would most likely suggest moving any such papers to Juho’s long-standing gamification track, as gamification is a different focus from our focus here. Gamification focuses primarily on how to take existing processes and add game-like structures and frameworks to those processes; in Games & Gaming we wish to focus on items that are indeed games, and not a non-game item with gaming elements placed on it.  Marketing / CfP 	As in past years, we will use mailing lists, Facebook groups, and word of mouth to publicize the mini-track. Mailing lists include AoIR (the Association of Internet Researchers) and Gamesnetwork (the discussion list of DiGRA, the Digital Games Research Association); Facebook groups include the game studies groups for both NCA and ICA as well as CHI Play. The co-chairs hope to attend a variety of conferences this spring, even if just virtually, and will encourage presenters speaking on relevant topics to expand their abstracts into full papers for submission to our mini-track at HICSS.  Specific Topics Paraphrasing last year’s CFP, submitted papers should contain a social dimension in the analysis or framing of digital games, examining, for example, sociability, social practices, communities (in-game, out-game, across multiple spaces or time), use of social affordances, or some other social dimension. With that in mind, and as part of the Digital and Social Media track, the Games & Gaming mini-track should cover the following topics: 	Streaming gameplay (e.g., Twitch). 	Network analysis of groups and communities in games. 	Social affordances of games. 	Social practice (in-game, out-game, both). 	Player communities. 	Fans and fan communities. 	Community management. 	Toxicity online. 	Multiplayer games. 	Cooperative and competitive play. 	Esports. 	Fantasy sports leagues. 	Multigenerational play. 	Intercultural play. 	Game curation via sites like Steam.

The integration of  technology and artificial intelligence into our programs, support systems and practices for  education, lifelong and professional learning is on the rise. In some cases the separation of  human and artificial learning is difficult to untangle. The use of technology, AI systems and  machine learning into learning environments opens up new questions, applications and  research methodologies. How, for example, does technology support change how humans  learn?, and Can we effectively develop agency, trust, analytics, feedback and interventions to  support learning in complex environments where boundaries between human and artificial  decision-making become blurred? What new capability and research will this integration  bring and how will it advance our current understanding of learning?    To leverage the HICSS context, we seek to bridge disciplines and research communities  between system sciences, AI, computer and learning sciences, so within this scope a broad  range of research questions, learning settings, and theoretical and methodological traditions  will be considered. We are flexible about what constitutes 'learning' (e.g., acquisition or co- creation of knowledge or skills, intersubjective meaning-making, legitimate peripheral  participation, advancing community knowledge, collective change) and about the nature of  the setting (e.g., face-to-face or online; formal or informal; educational, professional or  leisure and mixtures thereof; with diverse technological media and artificial intelligence  mediating networked or community social interaction), but learning and the DSM setting  should be considered in relation to each other rather than one without regard for the other.     Papers should make a theoretical and/ or empirical contribution or establish the value of a  methodological or design innovation: it is not sufficient to merely document use of a  technology in a learning context or apply a well-worn model without new insights. Within  these guidelines, the range of topics we consider are broad. We are particularly interested in:  •  The awareness, impact and effects of the integration of human and artificial learning in  digital and social media learning environments.  •  How the affordances of technological systems influence learning in digital and social  media environments.  •  Deepening the theoretical understanding that underlines processes of human and artificial  learning in digital and social media.  •  How the affordances of digital and social media, learning analytics and AI systems  influence or are appropriated for studying learning and/or the development of learning  support or feedback systems.  •  How the affordances of digital and social media, learning analytics and AI systems  influence or are appropriated in learning design, teaching and delivery of learning  programs.  •  Understanding the integration of human and artificial learning at the nexus of distributed  work, complex problem solving, and knowledge sharing.  •  How the integration of analytics, algorithms and machine learning in digital and social  media environments (for example Twitter, Facebook) are used of influences learning and  teaching practices.  •  Using (big)data from digital and social media to understand learning. New methods,  analytics and AI application for studying and supporting teachers and learners.

Modern streaming technology is a special delivery  method of different media (usually audio or video) from a server to a client and nowadays increasingly  applied in the entertainment and education industry (as an alternative to the conventional file download, or  forms  of  broadcasting).  We  differentiate  between on-demand, or asynchronous streaming technology  (seen in e.g. Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, Youku Tudou), and live, or synchronous, streaming technology  (seen in e.g. Twitch, YouNow, Instagram Live, Taobao Live) and short-form video formats embedded in  social  media  (e.g.  TikTok,  Snapchat,  Kuaishou  or  “Stories”-feature  on  Facebook  or  Instagram).  On-demand  streaming  targets  a  more  consumption-oriented  audience  (with  focus  on  passive  entertainment),  whereas  live  streaming  offers  the  possibility for active interaction between the users  (which  can  lead  to  more  active  social  exchange). With the advent of social live streaming services  (SLSSs), live TV and social media merged. SLSSs include a backchannel from the viewer to the streamer  - and among the viewers; they allow their users to broadcast their programs to everyone who wants to  watch,  all  over  the  world.  Some  SLSSs employ elements of gamification to motivate their users to  continuously engage with the respective service and since the beginning of last years’ pandemic, streaming  media has become more popular than ever, creating new research opportunities.   Nowadays live and on-demand streaming is an important aspect of digital and social media. However, the  research on this multifaceted topic is still developing . We possess only limited knowledge on this research  area, which can be examined through various different lenses such as the media format: audio (e.g. music,  podcasts) or video, content type: professionally produced content (e.g. Netflix, HBO, Disney Plus) or user  generated  content  (e.g.  Twitch,  YouTube),  the  technology of delivery: asynchronous (e.g. YouTube,  Netflix) or synchronous (e.g. Twitch, YouNow) and through the lense of the consumer or producer (or  even  the  merger  of  these  two)  In  this  minitrack we are looking for theoretical, conceptual and  ​ empirical papers investigating video streaming, audio streaming. Furthermore, we welcome research  ​ fostering our understanding on the production and usage of, and user participation on, general social live  streaming services (e.g., Twitch or YouTube), embedded systems in other services (e.g., Instagram Live,  niconico  or  Facebook  Live)  and  esports  streaming  and  streamers  (e.g.,  Twitch,  Douyu).  We  also  acknowledge  the  regional  differences  of  streaming  services,  popularity  and  their  development,  and  welcome research from various different regions, (such as pioneering regions e.g. Asia).   We anticipate submissions including (but not limited to) the following topics:  ● Information/content production and/or consumption behavior on streaming services  ○ User participation and engagement on social streaming services (e.g. chatting, giving  “hearts,” commenting, donating)  ○ Multichannel behavior  ○ Social and community behaviour on streaming services (e.g. parasocial interaction and  relationships)  ● The economy of streaming services and individual streamers   ○ Professionalised and commercial strategies of streamers (e.g. influencers and  micro celebrities)  - ○ Business models and the economy of streaming services  ○ Consumer behavior  ○ Streaming e-commerce  ● Streaming technology and development  ● The role of streaming services in the dissemination of news and information (also misinformation)  ● Legal aspects of streaming (e.g., copyright or personality rights violations)  ● Organisational and institutional utilization of streaming  ○ Streaming services and media in education and academia    Topics by types of media:  ● Live streaming  ○ Social Live Streaming (e.g., Periscope, Inke)  ○ Live stream function in other services (Facebook Live, IGTV, niconico)  ○ eSports (e.g., Twitch, Mixer, Douyu)  ○ Audio (live radio, podcasts)  ○ e-Commerce (e.g., Taobao Live)    ● On-Demand streaming  ○ user-generated video (e.g., YouTube, Youku Tudou) or  audio (e.g., SoundCloud)  ○ commercial video (e.g., Netflix, iQiyi) or audio (e.g., Spotify, Apple Music)  ○ learning/educational video (e.g., Udemy, Udacity)    ● Short-form video formats and vlogs in digital media  ○ e.g., TikTok, Kuaishou  ○ Instagram/Facebook stories  ○ WhatsApp stories  Marketing plan:  ● Distribution of the CFP via lists/in the communities: AnyKey, Center of Excellence in Game Studies,  Association of Internet Researchers, GAMESNETWORK, Esports Research Network, ASIS&T  (European Chapter, European Student Chapter, Social Media Special Interest Group and possibly  further Special Interest Groups)  ● Distribution of the CFP within the networks of the four minitrack chairs (LinkedIn, Twitter,  ResearchGate, Facebook)  ● We have compiled a list of authors doing research in streaming technologies/entertainment (and who  published on this topic in the last 2-3 years) and will email them directly with the CFP (around 150  contacts)  ● We will send the CFP to colleagues from other institutions (e.g., Computer Science, LIS) with the  request to share it within their networks.

Big data-driven social media also carries and propagates essential information that reflects public opinions and personalized preferences on products, events, service, etc., with a huge impact on both individuals and organizations. On the one hand, organizations may need to adopt big data-based techniques to better understand the mechanisms of related opinions, social influence, commercial behaviors related to social media. On the other hand, big data-driven methodologies have been designed to meet and discover individuals’ personalized purposes (e.g., making friends, commodity collaborations, and knowledge acquisition) in social media, supporting their future activities before they make decisions. This minitrack intends to explore and inspirit fresh multidisciplinary studies that offer insights into big data-driven social media management. We look for studies investigating how big data and intelligent techniques in social media provides unique value to both individuals and organizations, and how to effectively adopt methodologies, e.g. big data analysis, for social media management.   Topics of interest include but are not limited to:  Big data-driven customer preference analysis in social media Big data-driven personalized recommendation in social media Big data-based consumer behavior management in social media Big data-based opinion identification and tracking in social media Big data-based opinion diffusion, guidance, evolution and management in social media Big data-based social media influence on enterprise’s performance Big data analysis & management in social media Big data analysis for individual or organizational social media presence Intelligent techniques and methodologies for social media management New issues and challenges in social media management         Minitrack Co-Chairs: Xiangbin Yan (Primary Contact) University of Science and Technology Beijing, China xbyan@ustb.edu.cn  Mingxin Gan University of Science and Technology Beijing, China ganmx@ustb.edu.cn  Short bio-sketch of minitrack chair and co-chairs:  Xiangbin Yan Dr. Yan is a Professor of Management Science & Engineering and the Dean of School in the School of Economics and Management at University of Science & Technology Beijing, China.

AISWorld and other listservs that we belong to will also be used. Furthermore, we will continue targeting Communication researchers, by circulating the CFP via the AoIR, ECREA, and other communication-centric listservs, sending the CFP to hand-picked researchers who participate in relevant NCA and ICA divisions, and reaching out to those who publish in Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication and in related communication journals. The details of the minitrack chair and co-chairs are at the bottom of the description, below.  Our organizations are aware of our involvement and provide the financial support that will allow at least one of us to attend HICSS every year.  Description: The Mediated Conversation minitrack focuses on the study of conversations taking place on digital and social media. Conversations are at the core of human communication.  Mediated conversations can use text, audio, images or video, or any combination thereof. The minitrack welcomes research on conversations that are interpersonal, as well as those that occur in organizational or mass communication, educational or political contexts, and in any other sphere of human activity, including the emerging interplay of human-machine communication.  Some examples of highly cited papers that first appeared in this minitrack include: Beyond Microblogging: Conversation and Collaboration via Twitter, by Honey & Herring; Talk before You Type: Coordination in Wikipedia, by Viégas, Wattenberg, Kriss and van Ham; You Are Who You Talk To: Detecting Roles in Usenet Newsgroups, by Fisher, Smith and Welser; Tweet, Tweet, Retweet: Conversational Aspects of Retweeting on Twitter, by boyd, Golder and Lotan; and, Learning Conversations in World of Warcraft, by Nardi, Ly and Harris.  This minitrack brings together researchers and innovators to explore mediated conversation and its implications; to raise new socio-technical, ethical, pedagogical, linguistic, and social questions; and to suggest new methods, perspectives, and design approaches. The Mediated Conversation minitrack is the successor of the Persistent Conversation minitrack established by Tom Erickson and Susan Herring at HICSS in 1999, which was originally focused on the novelty of conversational persistence. With the prevalence of mediated conversation, we are called upon to consider a wider field of issues. Examples of appropriate topics include, but are not limited to: Innovation in mediated conversational practice The dynamics and analysis of large-scale conversation systems (e.g., MOOCs and big data applications) Methods for analyzing mediated conversation: qualitative, quantitative, data analytics, etc. Mediated collaboration The dark side of mediated conversation: e.g., loafing, hate speech, bullying, and communication overload Studies of virtual communities or other sites of mediated conversation Ethics and mediated conversation: privacy, deception, freedom of speech, security, and information warfare The role of mediated conversation in knowledge management The role of mediated conversation in organizations Domain-specific applications, opportunities, and challenges of mediated conversations and conversational exchanges (e.g., in education, healthcare, social movements, government, citizen participation, management, and news media) Conversation visualizations and analytics The role of listeners, lurkers, and silent interactions Novel properties of mediated conversation A platform’s role in mediating the conversation Power dynamics and conversational patterns among users of social media The role of conversation in understanding the interplay between media producers and media audiences Human-machine communication and related conversations (e.g., chatbots) Fast track journal opportunity: Authors of papers accepted for presentation in the minitrack will be offered the opportunity to submit an extended version of their papers for consideration for fast-track publication in the ACM journal ACM Transaction on Social Computing ()  Short bios: Professor Sheizaf Rafaeli studies the design, use and impact of online systems, and is interested in the social, organizational, cognitive, educational, business, ethical and political aspects of networks and big data.

Network analysis reveals the underlying structure and the dynamic interactions among system components. Network science and the development of digital and social media have co-evolved as catalysts of each other’s advancement, and the increased use of social and digital media provides scientists with a wealth of precise and novel data.   We welcome submissions that represent insightful ways that network analysis can be used to better understand social and digital media. Both methodologically and theoretically driven papers are encouraged, as well as empirical research (e.g. telecommunication, health, website specific, international, organizational, etc.) that push the boundaries of network science as applied to social and digital media. Forward-thinking and boundary-spanning forms of research including, but not limited to, the study of multi-level, localized and ego-centric networks are welcome.  List of topics, as related to Digital and/or Social Media:  Theories of Social Networks  Models of Social Networks Communication Networks Telecommunication Networks Internet World-wide Web Longitudinal Network Analysis Visualization of Social Networks Two-mode / Affiliation / Bi-partite Networks Determining Network Structure and Processes Self-organizing and Decentralized Networks  Social Influence Social Factors  Minitrack Chair Information and Bio’s:   Kar-Hai Chu (primary contact) Center for Social Dynamics and Community Health University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health 130 DeSoto Street Pittsburgh, PA 15261 Email:  Office Phone: (412) 692-2578  Bio: Kar-Hai Chu (Ph.D., University of Hawaii at Manoa) is currently Associate Professor of Public Health at the University of Pittsburgh.

He has developed social and semantic network-analytic methods for the analysis of dynamic social and communication networks in online environments.   George A. Barnett  Department of Communication University of California – Davis One Shields Drive, Davis CA 95616 Email:  Phone: 530-752-3674 Bio: George A. Barnett (Ph.D., Michigan State University) is Professor and Chair of the Department of Communication at the University of California - Davis. He is past President of the International Network of Social Network Analysts and editor of the Encyclopedia of Social Networks. Professor Barnett's research concerns structural models of the role of communication in social and cultural processes.    2) Discussion of Minitrack:   The Network Analysis of Digital and Social Media minitrack focuses on the area of social network analysis that investigates on the flow of information or resources in social and digital media. Research on social network analysis is conducted in a wide range of sciences, and as such it is necessary to attract scholars from different fields to share methodological advances and establish theoretical parallels.  The science of network analysis has progressed in parallel with the use of social and digital media. The precise measurement of communicative flows has been a challenge, and the increased use of social media to manage communicative interaction has provided social network scientists with a wealth of precise and novel data. Further, the increased analytic representation and theoretical understanding of new media and information systems provides developers with improved insights into the uses of technology to manage the resources embedded in their social networks.   Digital and social media have provided precise measures of social networks. From social networking sites (e.g. Facebook), to microblogging networks (e.g. Twitter) and global cooperation networks (e.g. Wikipedia), the material and nonmaterial exchanges of individuals and larger social systems are being recorded and largely retrievable, presenting social network researchers with powerful new data. There are four main implications of having access to digital and social media data. First, we now have access to measurements of network relations that are more reliable than in the past. Second, the nature of the relational data is unique, allowing for the analytical exploration of network structures in ways that are pushing the boundaries of the science. Third, analysis of network evolution is increasingly possible since much of the data available through social media is dynamic (a historically persistent challenge when collecting network data). Fourth, dynamic network data has contributed to visualization methods that allow for the animation of social networks.  Examples of scholars that the Network Analysis of Digital and Social Media mini-track will continue to attract are:  Organizational and business school scholars that use network analysis in their research, specifically those that are collecting network data from social media and networks of online coordination.  World systems and international relations scholars who analyze the global flow of information through social and digital media. Communication scholars that study the structure of both ego-centered and complete communication network data, and who are researching information technologies that allow for network analysis Computer systems scholars that are interested in networks of information flow in social media Health science researchers who use digital and social media to explore behavioral health outcomes by applying network theories and analyses  Marketing of the Network Analysis of Digital and Social Media minitrack will take place via distributed messages amongst organizational listserves and newsletters in the fields of Social Network Analysis, Communication, Information Science, Management, Organizational Behavior, World Systems Research, and other fields as seen appropriate.   It is of note that one of the minitrack chairs, George Barnett, is the former president of the International Network of Social Network Analysis (INSNA), which will provide us with a key organizational connection to researchers who are already associated with this field of study. Additionally, all minitrack chairs are well connected and organizationally involved in the major Communication and New Media associations.    We have been running this minitrack in some form at HICSS for over 10 years, and although we have usually programmed 1 or 2 panel sessions for this, the room is always full and the dialogue is excellent. It is interesting to note that we have been successful at attracting authors at the absolute highest level in the field. We expect to be able to continue the quality and reach.  3) Parallel Conference Activity:   Many of the parallel conference and publications relevant to HICSS have mirrored the interest in social networks. Examples of conferences that have included sessions related to the proposed minitrack are; several ACM conferences such as Hypertext and Hypermedia, WWW, SIGWEB, SIGSPATIAL, SIGKDD, the SIGAPP Conference on Computational Aspects of Social Networks, and SIGCHI, IEEE conferences such as the International Conference on Advances in Social Network Analysis and Data Mining, the International Workshop on Network Science For Communication Networks at the upcoming INFOCOM Conference on Computer Communications. In addition to the ACM and IEEE conferences, several national and international conferences have had sessions on communication networks such as the National Communication Association, the International Communication Association, the American Sociological Association, the International Conference on the Design of Cooperative Systems, and the INSNA Sunbelt Conference.  HICSS continues to be uniquely positioned to bring together scientists from across many different fields to discuss the application of network analysis to digital and social media, and to understand how the approach can inform their own form of systems science. Systems are at core of network science, and it is appropriate that there continues to be a minitrack specifically for Network Analysis at HICSS, since it is one of the foremost forums for interaction of scientists interested in systems and technology.  4) Our organizations endorse our involvement and will pay for our travel and registration cost to attend HICSS."

With accelerated speed there are more and more websites tapping into the ‘wisdom of crowds’ as a source of information that influences our everyday decision-making. The internet has revolutionized the manner in which individuals obtain the information they need to make informed decisions. Using OSN can accelerate or decelerate the DM process for both individuals and communities through the accessing of data from multiple sources. While ample independent research exists on OSN and DM, there is a lack of research into how online technology affects the making of decisions that have an impact on our lives. How do we use OSN in our most important everyday decision-making is a substantially unanswered question. The synergy of these themes provides a unique research perspective from which to take a fresh look at both DM research and the actual process of DM as it is affected by the use of OSN. The main purpose of this mini track is to explore and extend, as well as challenge, existing knowledge of OSN and DM. We hope to: Understand and ascertain whether OSN can support and empower users in their decision-making process and particular phases; Identify and conceptualize new phases (if any) in the decision-making process that is integral to OSN conversations; Explore the structure and sequence of decision-making phases arising out of the use of OSN Identify biases, strengths and weaknesses of the human psyche that could be attenuated and/or enhanced through appropriate design of OSN for decision-making Seek practical guidelines for the design of OSN that support blended decision-making processes that leverages the wisdom of crowds We welcome conceptual, theoretical, and empirical papers that enrich our understanding of this. All methodological approaches are welcome.  Topics of interest include but are not limited to:  Decision Making in OSN The impact of OSN on Decision Making Types of OSN for Decision Making Decision Support in OSN Typology of Users of OSN for Decision Making Traditional and New Decision Models and Theories in OSN Biases in OSN for Decision Making Online vs Offline Decision Making Structure of Decisions in OSN Phases of Decision Making Processes in OSN Decision Making Governance, Risk, and Compliance in OSN OSN Security and Privacy Decision Making Processes and Systems Apps, Tools and Technologies for Decision Making A particular focus is on Health and Financial OSN   Mini-track Chairs:  Valeria Sadovykh Dr. Valeria Sadovykh works for a global consulting firm as a technology consultant based in New York.

They comprise various applications, including social networking platforms, online/content communities,  collaborative project management tools, collaborative technologies, blogs, wikis, and crowdsourcing sites,  among the well-known [3]. Based on prior research [4] [5] [6] [7] [8], social information systems are de- fined as information systems [9] that support emergent interactions. In contrast to other application sys- tems (e.g. in the transaction setting), interactions emerge in run-time between two or more participants  based on mechanisms that make social information systems more difficult to design. Among these mech- anisms are social production [10], weak ties [11], egalitarianism [12], mutual service provisioning [3] and  shared values.   In addition, the past years have shown that social information systems are often related with digital plat- forms and ecosystems, which feature characteristics such as attracting users, matching users with com- plementary interests, and facilitating user interaction [13]. These features and the associated direct and  indirect network effects are key for understanding and designing social platforms and ecosystems [14]  [15]. Direct network effects are linked with the number of users of a particular type and indirect network  effects represent the impact on the value for a user group by the growth of other user groups. In this  respect, platform business models [13] such as Airbnb or crowdsourcing platforms need social information  systems to evaluate and integrate resources while social platform such as Facebook are increasingly linked  with e-commerce transaction functionalities. From this perspective, social information systems and plat- forms may be regarded as ""glue"" in distributed business processes.   The support of emergent interactions and the need for enabling network effects increase the complexity  of social information systems and platforms significantly. In this way, the design of social information sys- tems complicates radically the prevailing information systems design using a management-defined plan  following Taylorism [16, 17]. The design of social information systems and platforms [1] [3] comprises not  only technical aspects and requirements (e.g., Web 2.0 techniques, semantic interoperability, data analysis  and fusion, social analytics), but also needs to consider the organizational, social and political context.   Focus of Social Information Systems and Minitrack  For the fifth time, the minitrack ""Social Information Systems"" promotes the scientific exchange on social  information systems and platforms regarding the economic, organizational, and technological challenges.  Possible themes are, but are not limited to:    How can organizations leverage social information systems and platforms to create business value  (e.g., in productivity or cost efficiencies)?    How may emergent interactions be assessed and measured (quantitatively, qualitatively)?     How are social information systems and platforms designed and what are suitable methodologies in  particular for strategic alignment?    How can network effects be fostered on social information systems and platforms?                What approaches exist to cope with the complexity of social information systems and platforms?    Which actions could be used to foster emergent interactions if a certain dimension of the business  value should be strengthened?    How may social information systems improve business processes and workflows beyond increasing  business value (e.g. by including meaning and engagement for users or stakeholders)?    How can actors be motivated to participate in social information systems and platforms?    How does the use of a specific social information system influence the organization and its strategy?    Is it possible to contain and prevent potential negative developments via organizational learning?      Which types of emerging interactions are used in which applications?    Which (new) business models are enabled by social information systems and how is this accom- plished?    How are social information systems used to create platforms and exchanges?    What is the relationship between social networking and transaction platforms?    How does the context (technological, organizational, political, cultural, situational…) of social infor- mation systems influence them?    Which social impacts are created by social information systems and which societal influences impact  information systems?    How are information systems helpful and/or harmful in societal crisis (pandemics etc.)?    …  Marketing plan  Based on the experiences of the last conferences, we will intensify the activities for directly addressing  potential authors and the broad effect of further measures will be increased. For HICSS 54 we used a di- rect-mailing with over 200 addresses for attracting submissions 2020. We aim to attract more submissions  by adding platforms and complexity to the scope of the minitrack.   Direct contact with active authors  The starting point is an intensive search for authors who have recently published at related conferences  on minitrack topics. These authors will be contacted via e-mail and invited to submit their work.   Leveraging the community  In order to improve the personal approach of potential authors, the chairs of the minitrack will specifically  activate multipliers in their communities. These will be used to address potential authors in a targeted  manner. The chairs of this minitrack proposal are in different program committees, boards, etc. Therefore,  a broad effect can be anticipated.   Website  In order to attract potential authors, a website will be set up that offers potential authors in-depth infor- mation and explanations on the topic of Social Information Systems. Among other things, a bibliography  with publications on the topic of Social Information Systems will be offered.   Social Media  The chairs of the minitrack are integrated into a variety of social media networks (Twitter, Facebook,  LinkedIn etc.,) through their other organizational activities. These are used for marketing the minitrack. As  a matter of course, all promotional activities provided by HICSS will be supported and integrated into the  marketing activities of the minitrack.

Advanced technologies will require sophisticated methods for understanding how they can be incorporated into increasingly complex and dynamic infrastructure.  We invite papers that examine issues of reliability, security, and resilience of interconnected power systems, including testbeds that will demonstrate the robustness of advanced technologies, and the associated computational and communication challenges associated with operating the power system. Session 1:  Grid Reinforcement, Testbeds and Synthetic Networks Session Organizers and Co-Chairs:  Mladen Kezunovic (kezunov@ece.tamu.edu) and Mert Korkali (korkali1@llnl.gov) The combined cascading failure of electricity and other infrastructure networks greatly increases the discomfort, safety, and economic loss to society. There are considerable challenges in modeling and coordinating the important interactions (possibly including human, market, or economic factors) and quantifying the adverse interactions so that their risk can be estimated, mitigated and controlled. It is also important to verify and quantify these interactions in large-scale testbeds. An essential part of the testbed design is creation of synthetic networks of various infrastructures that allow the scale and complexity to be faithfully represented allowing evaluation of novel robust solutions. Methods for reinforcing networks through hardening the physical components or offering distributed energy resources (DER) as network support are of interest as well. The objective of this session is to describe new methods to analyze and quantify electric, gas, communications or water network outages and their interactions with each other so that they can be better mitigated. Novel test approaches that are enabling physical and virtual testing of the interactions, as well as large scale synthetic networks that are creating realistic test environment are needed. Papers describing new approaches to modeling and testing complex infrastructure failures in the context of complex systems, complex networks, and probabilistic analyses of cascades among interacting networks are encouraged. Papers using testbeds should state the hypotheses being tested and discuss the conclusions about the hypotheses’ validation. Joint papers from multiple organizations that have federated testbed facilities or are working on development of synthetic networks are welcome. (Expect 3 to 4 papers in this session) Session 2:  Data Analytics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Session Organizers and Co-Chairs: Le Xie (le.xie@tamu.edu) and Xiao Chen (chen73@llnl.gov) The electric power system is a safety-critical infrastructure system. Operators now have an unprecedented wealth of data from a variety of sources such as demand response participants, synchrophasors, and enhanced SCADA systems.  If managed properly, this data can provide opportunities to increase the efficiency, reliability, and overall performance of the power system.  With the increased adoption of grid modernization, demand response programs, and distributed generation that is often renewable, intermittent, and stochastic, system operators need to manage vast amounts of data in the presence of data inaccuracy and system uncertainties.  This introduces new opportunities for various artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies including probabilistic AI/ML. This session invites technical papers presenting new approaches, methods, and applications related to data analytics including AI/ML that advances the state of the art for safety-critical applications in planning, designing, operating and protecting electric power systems. This session will address challenges and opportunities associated with big data coming from a variety of sources such as behavior data in demand response, synchrophasors, weather, and enhanced control and other data acquisition systems.

Innovations that focus on recent developments in the area of large-scale dynamics and control for power systems and on distributed decision and control concepts for generation, storage, and loads are specifically sought for this year’s program. Session 1: Large Scale Dynamics and Control  Session Organizer and Session Chairs – Mani Venkatasubramanian (mani@eecs.wsu.edu) and John Pierre (pierre@uwyo.edu) The power system is a large-scale nonlinear system consisting of hundreds of dynamic components including synchronous generators and their controls, nonlinear loads, and complex power electronic devices such as those found in wind generators and flexible transmission controllers. Modeling and simulation of the underlying large-scale differential-algebraic equations are essential for understanding fundamental questions in power system planning and operations. Recent measurement based real-time monitoring and control algorithms are providing a renewed look at the dynamic phenomena of the interconnected power system through synchronized wide-area measurements in the form of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and Synchronized point-on-wave measurement devices. With the availability of such large-scale synchronized measurements in the power system today, there is an urgent need to combine model-based power system dynamic research and measurement based monitoring and control algorithms towards advancing real-time operational reliability of electric power grids. Increased presence of grid following and grid forming inverter based renewable generation sources requires new analytical methods for their control, integration, coordination and protection. This session will showcase recent developments in the area of large-scale dynamic research in the power system area. (Expect 3 to 4 papers in this session) Session 2: Distributed Decision and Control  Session Organizer and Chair: Judy Cardell (jcardell@email.smith.edu) and Felipe Wilches-Bernal (fwilche@sandia.gov) Electric power systems are currently transitioning from centralized power production towards more decentralized power generation. This transition is partially driven by the advent of renewable energy resources such as solar and wind, and by technologies such as energy storage and controllable loads. In addition to being more dispersed, newer technologies tend to be interfaced with the grid by power-electronics inverters which gives them the ability to provide grid services with appropriate control strategies. These changes call for new control techniques to exploit the potential of distributed resources in enhancing the operations of the electric grid. Distributed control approaches considered in this session will range from protection schemes at the very fast time scales of microseconds to short-term operations and planning decisions at larger time scales. The papers in this session will present new control theory, tools and testbeds for controlling large-scale energy infrastructure using diverse actuating resources such as distributed generation, controllable loads and energy storage systems. They will address the fundamental obstacles to generalizable methodologies for controlling large-scale complex engineered systems while economically and reliably achieving evolving local and global performance objectives."
"HICSS-54","ES","Electric Energy Systems","7c69912d-3eeb-4849-9354-114b9b6947d9","Resilient Networks","Public concerns about the adverse environmental and health effects of using fossil fuels and nuclear power to generate electricity have led to a greater reliance on renewable sources of generation that are inherently variable and uncertain. This trend is accompanied by increased proliferation of distributed resources, storage and smart grid technologies that facilitate demand response and greater observability of the grid. As a result the electric power industry faces new challenges in planning and operation of the power system that require new market mechanisms, computational optimization tools and innovative risk management strategies and tools to achieve productive and allocative efficiencies. A key concept in addressing the new challenges associated with renewables integration and in mobilizing a diverse resource portfolio to mitigate the uncertainty and variability of these intermittent resources is flexibility and risk mitigation . Hence, a central theme of this mini track revolves around identifying metrics and the needs for risk and flexibility. A second theme emphasizes the characterization of market products and public policies that incentivizes optimization and diversification of resources to assure system reliability in face of uncertainty, at least cost. Additionally, we are interested in work focusing on coordination of electricity system with other critical infrastructure systems such as natural gas supply. The first session focuses on market design and analysis while the second focuses on computational aspects of optimizing the planning, operation and procurement of a diverse resource portfolio, and on the management of risk along the energy supply chain as well as the coordination of energy related infrastructures. Session 1: Market Design and Implementation  Session Organizer and Session Chair: Richard D. Tabors (rtabors@tcr-us.com) The electric power industry is undergoing a series of both dramatic and exceedingly rapid changes. The forces at play are being driven by the changing generation portfolio (decarbonization) that is moving generation away from fossil technologies toward increased intermittent, zero marginal cost renewable technologies. Decentralization of both generation and control is being driven by Distributed Energy Resource (DER) availability, creating the prosumer who is able to move away from but not entirely leave the grid. These forces are amplified by the digital revolution that is affecting the entire economy of which the utility industry is but a minor portion but from which the industry is able to benefit. Utilities are being expected to maintain the reliability of delivered energy with fewer firm resources, more intermittent resources and far greater uncertainty in net demand at the interfaces between the wholesale and retail segments of the system. This session aims to bring together leading researchers for comprehensive discussions of the metrics and market structures that will provide the flexibility to adapt to the rapidly changing demands of electric energy systems. The flexibility will inherently cover multiple time scales and can be extracted from the supply side (both traditional and renewable technologies) and from the demand side as DERs, energy storage and responsive demand. Papers that discuss innovative assessment and provision of flexibility from both theoretical and empirical perspectives are encouraged. (Expect 3 to 4 papers in this session) Session 2: Risk Management and Optimization Session Organizer and Session Chairs: Masood Parvania (masood.parvania@utah.edu) and Hao Zhu (haozhu@utexas.edu) Recent progress in optimization theory and software development complimented by dramatic increases in the capability of low cost computer hardware is opening the door for the development of a new generation of methods to assist in the planning and operations of large-scale energy systems such as electric power grids and gas transmission networks. Increased investment and adoption of renewable energy, electric energy storage and systems to facilitate demand response continue to challenge power grid operators in both the operation and planning of a reliable electric infrastructure. The emergence of natural gas as a major fuel for electric generation (and the emergence of the power generation sector as the main area of growth for natural gas transmission services) has brought its own challenges to both electricity and natural gas. Efforts to harmonize market clearing and system operations for electric and gas transmission have been hampered by difficulties in adapting appropriate pricing models for both systems. Meanwhile, high penetration levels of stochastic resources and increasing threats of cyber attacks and natural disasters present great risks to reliable and resilient operation of energy systems. Coordinated planning of electric and gas supply systems needs new tools that integrate systems optimization, market feedbacks, risk management approaches, and the potential for strong system coupling to enhance or hinder reliable operations. On the other hand rapid proliferation of edge technologies facilitates the transition from treatment of risk as a centrally managed public good to privatization of risk and the sharing of supply risk along the energy supply chain. The objective of this session is to bring together papers focused on new problem formulations, algorithmic developments and computational advances that directly address the operational, planning and reliability challenges being faced by operators and users of large-scale energy transmission infrastructures. Papers focusing on new approaches to power flow optimization, stochastic and robust unit commitment, and coordination of power grids and markets with other infrastructures (particularly natural gas transmission) are particularly encouraged. We are also interested in papers on topology control, chance constrained optimization and multi-objective programming. Furthermore, this session welcomes novel research to advance the grid operation model with new understanding of asset and system risk and new risk management approaches (Expect 4 papers in this session) "

The regulatory and market environment in which these resources operate is also changing, with the growth in wind and solar energy necessitating additional requirements for grid support services (such as Order 841 recently passed by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which mandates the development of models for energy storage to participate in regional bulk power markets). Effective integration of distributed resources (behind the meter supply and storage), weather dependent renewables, and mobile electric energy supply and storage through electrified transportation requires evolution in planning, operational and control strategies, as well as an appreciation of how people will adopt and use distributed and mobile resources. This minitrack invites papers that address modeling, simulation and hardware developments; economic and system analyses; and studies of individual and organizational (including governments) behavior and decision making as pertaining to distributed, renewable and mobile resources in electric power systems. Session 1:  Grid-Scale Integration Session Organizer and Chair – Charlie Smith (charlie@esig.energy) Electricity market restructuring, advances in energy generation technology and agreements on the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions have paved the way for a significant increase in the use of renewable generation connected at both the transmission and distribution level. With wind generation currently having the largest share of the new capacity, and solar generation having the highest rate of growth, this trend is expected to continue to produce an increasing amount of variability and uncertainty in system generation portfolios. A broad array of issues associated with the incorporation of large shares of variable generation (VG) into power system planning, design, and operation, including market operation, need to be considered. This session invites technical papers addressing new approaches, models and methods for the planning, design and operation of power systems with large or increasing shares of VG, including the impact of distributed energy resources on the bulk system reliability. We particularly encourage paper that focus on the key issues of managing increased levels of variability and uncertainty on the transmission system with new approaches to increasing co-ordination, system flexibility, the value and role of new grid support services, and incorporating VG plant output forecasting on all time scales, is encouraged. Integration of renewable resources will also require continuing innovation in technology capability to enable the participation of variable generation in AGC systems and ancillary service markets.  New approaches to the evolution of the wind and photovoltaic plant design to enable this participation, including wind/PV/battery hybrids and grid forming converters, are necessary. This session will address some of the challenges and approaches to achieve these goals. (Expect 3 to 4 papers in this session) Session 2: Grid-Edge: Coordination, Communication, and Consumers Session Organizer and Chair: Ward Jewell (ward.jewell@wichita.edu) Distributed energy resources (DERs) include customer-side generation, energy storage (including mobile storage through electrified transportation), flexible loads, and distribution-side sensing devices, and may or may not have coordinated operation as microgrids. DERs can play an important role in providing services to the power system. Flexible loads can be scheduled to balance variable generation; microgrids and strategic storage can provide reliability and security; and distributed sensing can offer unprecedented system visibility. Integration of DERs requires continuing innovation in coordinated control, optimization, modeling, and technology to enable participation in regulation and balancing services, ancillary service markets and distribution system management. Moreover, growth in mobile and stationary DERs vastly increases the number of independent decision-makers providing services to the grid. How these customer-suppliers will interact with DERs and the larger power grid is still evolving rapidly. This session invites technical papers presenting new approaches, models and methods for planning, operating, and architecture of, interconnected transmission and/or distribution systems with significant DER penetration. This session also invites papers that use methods from social science or data analytics to explore the interactions between DER owners at the individual or community scale, the technologies  they control, and the power distribution and transmission system.

The study and refinement of these  sensors, their architecture, applications and linked interventions represent novel methods for the  remote detection and management of a myriad of disease states, and have taken on increased  urgency as the COVID-19 pandemic has expedited the adoption of a new paradigm of health  care delivery that emphasizes remote care. Thus, while commercial sensor suites have  previously been consumer facing and centered around exercise and fitness, traditionally  conservative healthcare systems have over the past year taken up the mantle of piloting and  adopting an increasing number of remote care platforms.     Since its inception, this minitrack has been a forum for the discussion of cutting-edge  ideas in body sensor implementation science in healthcare. The gathering of leading experts  from a variety of disciplines facilitates the successful deployment and integration of these  sensor systems across disparate hospital systems with unique healthcare IT infrastructures, and  this cross-pollination of ideas has taken on increasing importance as these systems are  increasingly adopted worldwide.     The journey from conceptual use of a sensor system to its ultimate implementation as a  research tool or clinical application is complex and requires a multidisciplinary team of  physicians, patients, social scientists and engineers. While body sensor systems have  traditionally been packaged into devices based on the needs and form factors envisioned by the  designer, the paradigm continues to shift towards user-center design. More than ever, there is a  critical need for systematic study of novel health information technology measures, and areas of  particular focus include pathways to adoption, user experiences for both patient and clinician,  ensuring security and reliability of patient data, and development and refinement of algorithms  to facilitate interpretation of increasingly complex data streams.    This Minitrack explores the pathway from design to deployment and integration of sensor  systems and novel IT platforms designed to diagnose or treat human health conditions. We  specifically encourage:  •  Team-based theory and approaches to building sensor systems  •  Qualitative work exploring implementation challenges of sensors in clinical practice,  consumer healthcare or research applications  •  Data-driven information technology platforms for assessment of acute changes in health  states (e.g., presence or absence of disease, intoxication, impairment)  •  Novel data processing techniques  •  Data architecture and patient-physician interfaces related to sensor systems  •  Behavioral interventions linked to sensor systems     Marketing Plan: This is our fifth year proposing this minitrack on novel patient-facing  applications of health information technology. We have learned from our previous four years,  and anticipate this year, we will attract a diverse group of authors and submissions to the  minitrack as it gains popularity. While our previous years’ minitracks focused on wearable  technologies and body sensor systems, we recognize that current interest is unparalleled in all  aspects of patient-facing IT implementations. As physician-scientists straddling the interface  between computer science and medicine, we are optimally positioned to facilitate discussions of  the timely and essential research questions in our minitrack proposal.    As with many other minitracks, participation at HICSS-54 was adversely impacted by COVID- 19. However, we are optimistic that 2022 will bring a return to in-person exchange of ideas at  HICSS-55, and an opportunity to propel this area of study forward based on lessons learned in  adapting to the unprecedented healthcare conditions brought about by the pandemic. Although  we were unable this year to incorporate a “Lessons Learned and Gaps Identified” discussion as  we have in years past, we remain receptive to continually improving this minitrack based on  participant feedback and emerging ideas generated by multidisciplinary discussions. We will  refine our marketing plan to solicit personalized invitations for submissions with researchers in  our network, including investigators in computer science, electrical engineering, mHealth, and  wearable-sensor-focused translational medicine. We additionally will encourage alumni of the  minitrack from HICSS 51-54 to submit papers. We will also advertise our Minitrack at health IT  conferences (Partners Connected Health, mHealth summit, HIMSS, IEEE wearables standards  workgroups and American Medical Informatics Association). We anticipate potential fast track  opportunities with the journals Frontiers in Digital Health, Journal of Medical Systems and/or  Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association. We believe that our history of injecting  participant-proposed ideas and concepts surrounding biosensors and patient-facing IT  implementations from our past minitracks will continue to increase paper submission and  attendance at this minitrack at HICSS-55 and beyond.

Chronic diseases and conditions, persist an entire lifetime and generally cannot be prevented by vaccines or cured by medication (Adams, Kirzinger, & Martinez, 2013). This mini-track characterizes Chronic Diseases and Conditions very broadly to include, illnesses (such as diabetes, Alzheimer asthma), conditions (such as physical, sensory, mental, and cognitive disabilities, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autistic spectrum, Tourette syndrome, old age related conditions).  Recurrent illnesses and conditions caused by chronic diseases, if not managed carefully, cannot only diminish quality of life and ability to work, but can also result in health emergencies, complications, and even death (World Health Organization, 2015). According to World Health Organization (WHO), chronic diseases are the leading cause of mortality worldwide, and 80% of chronic disease deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries.  Advancing patients’ ability to engage in self-managed health through information and communication technologies (ICTs), such as mobile technologies and machine learning, is increasingly a top priority (e.g., The National Health Service, 2013, The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, 2014). Effective self-management is a proven way of improving the lives of individuals suffering from chronic diseases (Dadgar and Joshi, 2018). Self-management refers to a care management approach in which patients actively take responsibility for treating their chronic diseases (Bodenheimer et al., 2002). It is a self-regulating, dynamic, continuous, interactive process (Schulman-Green et al., 2012). Despite technological advances in healthcare ICTs that improve care and reduce costs, patients often avoid using them (El-Gayar, Timsina, Nawar, & Eid, 2013). Although, ICTs have improved the health in healthcare services in terms of the delivery of high-quality patient care at low cost, but the development of ICTs that focus chiefly on patient-centered care is still in its infancy (Jacelon, Gibbs, & Ridgway, 2016). With that in mind, we are looking for papers taking a variety of approaches to answering research questions related to the design, development, and use of ICTs on patient-centered care. Such approaches might be described as experiments or quasi-experiments, design science, case studies, surveys, action research, psychometrics, and ethnography. We invite papers that use variety of advanced technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), or Machine Learning (ML). We call for the papers that investigate use of ICTs for patients with chronic physical and psychological conditions, from diabetes and asthma, to obesity and fitness SM programs, to autism, dementia, bipolar disorders, and depression. Studies that investigate technologies that help patients with chronic diseases improve their health and wellness can also be submitted to this minitrack.  Authors are invited to submit papers that address issues related to the design, development, and implementation of ICTs in self-management of chronic diseases and conditions. Potential issues and topics include, but are not limited to:  Learning about condition and health needs  Learning self-management regimen, skills, and strategies ( e.g., Monitoring and managing symptoms, side effects, and body responses, Adjusting treatment regimen to manage symptoms and side effects, Managing/taking medications, Goal setting, decision making, problem solving, planning, prioritizing and pacing in the self-management process) Managing life style changes (e.g. modifying diet, nutrition, smoking, and physical activity, Changing behaviors to minimize disease impact, Balancing living life with health needs, Managing disruptions in school, work, family, and social activities) Managing psychological aspects of chronic diseases and conditions (e.g. Developing confidence and self-efficacy, Reducing stress caused by the chronic disease, Identifying and benefiting from psychological resources drawing on intrinsic resources, e.g., creativity, strength and wisdom from past experiences, Maintaining positive outlook, hope, and self-worth, Dealing with shock of diagnosis, self-blame, and guilt) Managing relationships with healthcare providers (e.g. Creating and maintaining relationships with healthcare providers) Managing and sustaining relationships with family, friends, relatives, and peers (e.g. Creating a community of peers with similar experiences, Obtaining and managing social support from family and friends) Cultivating courage, discipline, and motivation Working through issues of dependence/independence Seeking resources, such as financial assistance (e.g., prescription subsidies), environmental support (e.g., assistive devices), and community resources (e.g., transportation) Exploring and expressing emotional responses Making sense of the chronic disease (e.g. Finding meaning in work, relationships, activities, and spirituality) Identifying and confronting change and loss (e.g., changes in physical function, role, identity, body image, control, and mortality) Developing coping strategies (e.g., self-talk) Focusing on possibilities (e.g., envisioning the future, reframing adversity into opportunity) Designing virtual coaches  ICT designs for elder care and home care  ICT enabled preventative approaches  References Adams, P., Kirzinger, W., & Martinez, M.

The  minitrack highlights how persuasive theories and models can be used to develop and evaluate  efficient and effective HBCSSs for different contexts, including healthcare.     As all HBCSSs are persuasive systems, designed with the intent to influence user behavior,  recognition of their applicability to patient health management is growing. Designing HBCSS  interventions with, and building technology platforms for, the patients as end-users is a major  area of research to combat health challenges and achieve the outcomes desired. Some example  topics are persuasive systems created for self-care, games designed to support chronic care, how  end-users can be involved to design a system, and evaluation methods to assess the impact of a  system on health behaviors.  Our minitrack presents a wide range of cutting-edge research addressing the challenges to  technology use for health behavior change. Emphasis in the minitrack will be placed on both  design and development of the HBCSSs, as well as evaluation, or appraisal, of their effects or  artifacts. The primary focus is not purely about methodologies or technologies, but also their  impact on a population or problem. Work to further develop design protocols and rigorous, long- term research is encouraged.   The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  Design and development  •   Create HBCSS interventions using stakeholders’ perspectives (users and experts)   •   Design of mobile technologies for health (mHealth) and mobile approaches to HBCSSs  •   HBCSS development that incorporates users early on in order to tailor systems with user  profiles, characteristics or preferences  •   Persuasive strategies to support activities offline (e.g. to support viewing and  downloading virtual exercises, social support in lifestyle changing programs)  •   Persuasive prompts to create engagement and involvement in serious game interventions  •   Creation and testing of user profiles to identify which persuasive strategies matter most  for whom  •   Discussion or evaluation of design approaches for developing HBCSSs, including  considerations for personalization, privacy and security  Implementation and evaluation  •   Health behaviour change through mobile technologies, teleconsultation and telemedicine  •   Patient education, patient empowerment, decision support tools for patients, and remote  monitoring  •   Evaluation of persuasiveness of different HBCSSs (mobile, ubiquitous, ambient  technologies), moving towards a checklist for practice  •   Adequate design for measuring the effect of persuasive strategies on task adherence  during usage and long-term effects  •   Frameworks and methodologies to measure A/B/C-Changes (attitude change, behavior  change, or an act of compliance)  •   Profiling personalities and matching them with persuasive strategies  •   Multimodal cues and measurement of the effects on adherence and outcomes  •   Advanced analytics to predict adherence, and to identify usage patterns and the effects on  adherence    Marketing Plan    Despite a challenging 2020 for researchers, our HICSS-54 minitrack was a success. We believe  this was due to our willingness to understand our authors’ concerns and meet their needs. Our  session was well-attended and stimulating dialogue followed authors’ presentations. We plan to  similarly support those accepted to present in our minitrack for HICSS-55 in 2022.      We have circulated the call for paper proposals to this minitrack in the past to our respective  academic and research networks, universities and relevant professional organizations. For  example, we have sent out the call to the Society of Behavioral Medicine’s special Interest group  “Behavioral Information Technology”. We will do so again this year. We will utilize the call for  papers for this minitrack using the same strategy, including at the annual Persuasive Technology  conference.     Additionally, the minitrack chairs have collected information from previous HICSS 2020 and  2021 minitrack attendees on their contact information and areas of interest. We will send out the  call for paper proposals to this group in addition to our previously-utilized strategies.     Journals for Fast-track Opportunity  N/A    Minitrack Co-Chairs    Amanda C.

The design of services is often different from  traditional service design—as for many healthcare services patients receive care, but  insurance companies pay for it. Implementing processes in this domain should result in  providing faster, safer and more effective care, necessitating organizing and sharing  information among all participants involved in patient care. While the need for well- defined healthcare processes is clear, there are many obstacles and opportunities for  research, including technical, behavioral, and organizational topics.   Operational Research approaches including mathematical programming and simulation  modelling can help address and solve logistical challenges in designing and managing  healthcare  processes  and  services.  While  mathematical  programming  can  give  the  optimal  locations  of  ambulances  or  shift  schedules  for  hospital  doctors,  simulation  approaches are a crucial tool to analyze different scenarios and model complex settings  like emergency departments or operating rooms.  Decision support systems play a crucial role in healthcare, not only in the form of clinical  decision support systems to assist physicians and other health professionals with medical  decision making, but also to support logistical and organizational processes.  This minitrack will focus on the analysis, design and optimization of healthcare systems,  the use of IT to support and improve care processes as well as non-IT assets such as  process changes, innovative IT artefacts, and interoperability standards.     We invite papers that focus on, but are not limited to:    •  Analysis and optimization of healthcare processes and services (e.g. patient  pathways, appointment planning, hospital logistics, emergency medical services)  •  Multi-criteria decision analysis of healthcare processes and services  •  Machine learning and artificial intelligence for healthcare processes and services  (e.g. demand forecasts, medical decision making)  •  Design of decision support systems in healthcare  •  Design and analysis of healthcare processes and services  •  Simulation studies of healthcare processes and services (e.g. emergency  departments, hospital logistics)  •  Simulation-optimization approaches for healthcare processes and services  •  The use of medical devices to support the processes and services  •  Organizational change management for implementing new processes  •  Impact of IT-enabled coordination of processes on patient/population health  outcomes (e.g. hospital readmissions, cost efficiency)      MINITRACK CO-CHAIRS:    Melanie Reuter-Oppermann, Technical University of Darmstadt, oppermann@is.tu- darmstadt   Cameron Walker, University of Auckland, cameron.walker@auckland.ac.nz  Nikolaus Furian, University of Graz, nikolaus.furian@tugraz.at       MARKETING PLAN:    Our marketing plan to solicit papers for our minitrack mainly consists of two parts:  personal advertisement and mailing lists/newsletters. We will send personal emails to  our collaborators, colleagues and reviewers from the last years to invite them to submit  to our minitrack. In addition, we will send the CfP to the mailing lists of ORAHS (the  European working group on Operations Research applied to Health Care), the mailing  list of the AIS (Association of Information Systems), the mailing list of VHB/WKWI (the  German economics and IS interest group) and the special interest group health within  the AIS. Moreover, we will send the CFP to the authors of the GOR (German OR society),  EURO (European OR society), ORSNZ (New Zealand OR Society), Informs and the  International Society on MCDM (Multiple Criteria Decision Making) newsletters.  The proposed CfP is based on the minitrack “Optimization, Simulation and IT for  Healthcare Processes and Services” that we chaired at this year’s HICSS and with a  slightly different title the two years before. We realized that the title could be even  more inviting to the community, and we also adapted the focus points based on the  feedback we received, during the overall process but also the online session. We also  shaped the focus of the minitrack a bit more. For the last 3 HICSS conferences we  received 10, 15 and 7 submissions and chose 4, 6 and 4 papers for presentations. For  HICSS 55, we aim at getting more submissions again with a stronger focus and an even  stronger advertisement.  The aim of the stronger focus is also to make it applicable for a fast-track opportunity at  a journal that focuses on optimization for healthcare. This will be addressed once the  minitrack proposal is accepted.

Though healthcare has traditionally been contained to predefined environments, health prevention, diagnosis and treatment, and ongoing monitoring is taking place at home, work and school. Healthcare is in high demand outside the walls of traditional healthcare facilities.  A wide range of organizations (e.g., home health providers, pharmacies, retailers, tech firms, large employers, and payers) are filling gaps in the marketplace that current care delivery providers are not meeting. Such examples are functional medicine enterprises, at-home diagnostic kits, remote patient monitoring, convenient on-premise-on-demand primary care, and synchronous or asynchronous virtual visits. Rapidly changing delivery models are shaping the new healthcare landscape far beyond a COVID-19 world.   A key focus of this minitrack is on the ever-changing nature of business, financial and care delivery models and the role of information systems and technology (IS&T) as enablers.   Potential topics include:  Ubiquitous Healthcare Innovations: Innovations supporting “in place” healthcare (eg. aging in place, rehabbing in place, disease monitoring, etc.) Remote screenings and diagnostics Demonstrations of information systems to further ubiquitous healthcare across populations and regions Social networking approaches to achieving ubiquitous healthcare IS&T as an enabler in equitable healthcare delivery across populations  Users, Stakeholders, and Policy: Pandemic policies and information system stakeholders Use cases for special populations (eg. Persons with disabilities, incarcerated people, youth, fitness, etc.) Integration of ubiquitous healthcare in graduate medical or other clinical education environments Challenges to the business model of traditional healthcare  Infrastructure Requirements and Developments for Ubiquitous Healthcare: Interoperability requirements and frameworks  COVID-19 product/service supply-chain and modeling Approaches and methods for achieving next generation delivery models Infrastructure needs or advances to improve current state healthcare delivery   This track seeks to highlight novel research on emergent digital health IS&T, including their design, field testing, evaluation, and broader impacts. We invite submissions that present innovative models, frameworks, and technologies that delve into how IS&T supports health to happen everywhere.

Developed economies already begin facing the issues arising from fewer young people having  to take care of more and more seniors and less developed countries are expected to be hit even  harder in the foreseeable future (World Health Organization, 2015).   The continuous evolution of technology has led to a multi-faceted digitization of health care  providing new possibilities for health and well-being for aging individuals and society at large.  Innovation in patient-centered technological solutions, such as smartphone apps, health gadgets  (smart watches etc.) and specific social media platforms indicate the increasing shift to self-  initiated and self-coordinated health measures. These offerings aim to support the preservation  of people’s physical, psychological, and social well-being, i.e. they enable longer autonomous  living.  Although contemporary technologies aim to assist people in health-related aspects they often  do not meet the specific needs and requirements of seniors. Hence, it becomes important to  understand how and why elderly people interact with technology and how adequate tools and  systems must be designed for this growing segment.  We invite papers that address the grand challenges ahead by providing insights (IS Research)  and suggesting innovative solutions (Design Science Research).   How can digital resources, including electronic health (eHealth) and  mobile health (mHealth) be used to help to provide health related services  for the aging generation?  The minitrack is open to a broad variety of research, conceptual or empirical. Topics of interest  include (but are not limited to):  •  Age-related digital divide in the IS discipline  •  Age-related roles and stereotypes with respect to technology  •  Specific IT/IS-adoption patterns of the elderly  •  Online and mobile health platforms and communities for seniors  •  The impact of e- and m-health, virtual communities, and social media on the well- being of seniors  •  Theories and research frameworks for investigating age-related IS phenomena   •  Methodological challenges of investigating elderly people’s technology usage  •  Impact of technology training on technology adoption and usage  •  Effective design of technology for elderly people  •  Factors influencing technology/e-health/m-health adoption and usage of seniors  •  Technology design factors influencing technology adoption and diffusion by seniors  •  Computer and Internet self-efficacy of seniors  •  Technostress of elderly people  •  Success factors, barriers and risks of technology adoption by seniors  •  Understanding of elderly people’s technology needs and requirements  •  User interface design, usability and accessibility issues  •  Integration of elderly people in the design of technology  •  Visions for future technologies for seniors  •  Meta-analyses and meta-syntheses of research on elderly people in various IS  phenomena  •  Novel and innovative research on technology for seniors  •  Trust and distrust of elderly people in e- and m-health  •  Changes in personality characteristics and its impact on adoption of technology    Minitrack Co-Chairs:     Heiko Gewald (Primary Contact)  Neu-Ulm University of Applied Sciences, Germany  Email: heiko.gewald@hnu.de    Karoly Bozan   Duquesne University, USA  Email: bozank@duq.edu    Doug Vogel  Harbin Institute of Technology, China  Email: vogel.doug@gmail.com      We ran this minitrack successfully over the last HIICSS conferences and would like to continue to do  so.

Papers will include studies that: (1) describe and seek to understand social media communities and approaches that address health issues; (2) evaluate the design, development, and implementation of social media applications; (3) assess the impact of these applications, including impacts on patients, healthcare providers, organizations, and society in general; and (4) develop theories and models to better understand the mechanisms by which social media produces impacts on healthcare and health behavior.   Research in this rapidly developing field must address key methodological questions, we therefore welcome submission that critically engage the following:     What is social media?  That is: what is it that makes technology-enabled online communications of health issues “social”?   How are health-related social media data appropriately accessed? And what constitutes an appropriate social media data set?   What analytic strategies or theories, quantitative and qualitative, are ideal for handling health-related social media data? How to best measure effectiveness, acceptability and reach of social media-delivered health education?  What human subjects, or ethical guidelines, inform the use of data obtained through social media? Are existing social media applications designed to produce medical, psychological or public health impacts effective, safe and acceptable?  Social media is changing the way patients, medical practitioners, and healthcare organizations interact.  Patients use social media to create communities with similar medical concerns or diagnoses, to research health related issues, and to inform their health decisions —including selecting a doctor or researching courses of treatment. Clinicians and researchers use social media to design and implement behavioral interventions for a variety of health conditions, and to study how social media shapes healthcare decisions.  Physicians use it to network professionally with colleagues and share knowledge within the medical community.  Healthcare providers and organizations use social media to serve their communities, patients, and physicians, while also building awareness and enhancing their brand.  Each of these uses provide opportunities to consider how social media influences health care, and to consider what data derived from social media exchanges – and which analytical methodologies – best serves this goal.    Marketing Plan:  We will review recent literature on relevant topics and reach out to authors of peer-reviewed journal articles to make them aware of HICSS and deadlines for paper submissions. We will also reach out to attendees of previous HICSS conferences and individuals who have presented relevant research at other national and international conferences. Local and national listservs of health technology research groups will be sent the accepted minitrack description for wide distribution.  We will also distribute the announcement at relevant local and national conferences.   Track History:  If accepted, HICSS 55 will be the sixth consecutive year for the social media and healthcare technology minitrack.  Since 2017 the track has hosted one or two sessions at the conference, with 4-7 papers discussed.  In 2019 we received 13 submissions to the track, more than half of which were from international scholars; in 2020 we had one session of four papers; in 2021 we held a live zoom session with presentation and discussion of four papers. We hope to expand to two sessions (six to eight papers) in 2022 and will increase our marketing to accomplish this.  For 2022 we have also added a new co-chair, Dr. Hamish Frasier, who adds significant public health informatics and evaluation experience, which is highly relevant for the papers the track solicits.  Journals for fast-track opportunities: the co-chairs are inquiring about fast-track opportunities with editors at JAMIA Open and Applied Clinical Informatics.

Nargess is a member of the Association for Information Systems (AIS). She is the instructor for  core topics in programming languages and software development.    Plans for Publicity  We had a chance to co-chair this minitrack in HICSS 2020. Although Covid-19 hit before we  started calling for the papers and many were reluctant to submit their work, not knowing if the  conference would be in person or online, we could run our session with 3 accepted papers. Being  involved in the publicizing process of this minitrack for HICSS 2021, we learned what works better  for attracting high-quality papers. One of the lessons learned is that to start very early publicizing  the minitrack and send follow-up emails to the researchers involved in these domains to remind  them of the deadlines.  In general, we plan to attract submissions by targeting specific professional conferences in related  fields  and  explore  established  partnerships  with  University  of  Nebraska  at  Omaha,  and  Management Center Innsbruck (MCI) University. The proposed minitrack will be publicized  among the participants of IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology (EMBS 2021) conference,  IEEE/ACM  conference  on  Connected  Health:  Applications,  Systems  and  Engineering  Technologies (CHASE 2021), AMCIS 2021, and a few other health-related conferences. In  addition, Elham Rastegari has established key partnerships with various health-related and VR- expert  groups  at  University  of  Nebraska  at  Omaha-Computer  Science  and  Biomechanics  Department, University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC)-Physical Therapy and oncology  Department,  and  Creighton  University  medical  school.  Several  Biomedical  Informatics  researchers and Computer Science experts from such Institutions have expressed interest in  participating in the proposed minitrack. This group forms another untapped source of publicity for  HICSS minitracks.   Nargess  Tahmasbi  and  Elham  Rastegari  have  both  attended  more  than  10  pioneering  IS  conferences in the past 5-7 years, through which they could build an extensive and strong network  of academics and professionals in the similar area of research at several institutions in the U.S. and  worldwide. They see this establishment as an asset that they can benefit to promote a call for paper.  More specifically, they will disseminate the CFP via online communities such as LinkedIn and  Facebook. Email communication would be used to share the CFP with the key contacts that are  known to Nargess and Elham at several institutions, among which are University of Nebraska at  Omaha (their Alma Mater), The Pennsylvania State University, Creighton University, University  of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC), University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), and Management  Center Innsbruck. The email will be sent out in three phases (initial, follow-up, and last call). It  will be requested that the original recipients further disseminate the CFP to their networks. During  the timeframe when the paper submission system is open, a link to the CFP for the minitrack will  be added to the email signature of the applicants as well.  In addition to the social media, the minitrack will be advertised on the WikiCFP website as well.     Institution’s support statement and Commitment of attendance    Creighton Business College has a long track record supporting HICSS conferences, and many  researchers from Creighton Business College have participated in HICSS in the last decade. In  particular,  Nargess  Tahmasbi  has  attended  and  presented  at  three  of  the  last  five  HICSS  conferences. Both Creighton Business College and Penn State College of Information Science and  Technology will provide any expenses or staff support needed for the minitrack.  "
"HICSS-54","IN","Internet and the Digital Economy","fb6299d1-e19a-4d6c-bbc3-70025b0fed5d","Artificial Intelligence-based Assistants","  Artificial Intelligence-based Assistants   Minitrack Proposal to the HICSS 2022   – Track Internet and the Digital Economy –   Description  Artificial Intelligence (AI) enjoys broad attention due to recent progress in multiple areas such as image  detection, translation, and decision support [1]. Many companies expect to gain a competitive edge  from AI [2]. The solutions for AI-enabled processes, products, and business models are continuously  becoming  increasingly  sophisticated  [3].  AI-based  assistants  are  an  important  and  particularly  innovative field in this development. They leverage AI in two ways. First, virtual personal assistants and  chatbots such as Amazon Alexa and the Google Home [4] redefine the interaction of human beings  with applications by enhancing the standard user interface via mouse, keyboard, and screen with  interactive text and voice. Second, AI-based assistants, referred to as Robotic Process Automation,  replace human actors when data need to be transferred between application systems.   From a technological perspective, the key technologies of AI-based assistants are present in numerous  areas of the digital economy. Among the examples are technologies such as natural language  processing, predictive analytics, machine learning, as well as voice recognition and generation. In this  way,  AI-based  assistants  are  evolving  towards  a  new  general-purpose  technology  [5].  On  the  application side, AI-based assistants unlock business value through automating processes, intensifying  the interaction with the customer, reducing errors, speeding up interactions etc.. Following the  understanding that information systems are socio-technical in nature, AI-based assistants should be  framed as a step toward humanizing technology and working environments.   Recent research [6] shows that AI-based assistants evolve towards digital platforms in themselves by  creating a rich ecosystem with skill providers, device vendors, etc. Direct and indirect network effects  within and between these groups may be observed [6], which opens further strategic venues for  applications in practice and research in academia.   Goal of the Artificial Intelligence-based Assistants Minitrack  Based on the successful event in 2021 with 14 submissions [7], the minitrack ""Artificial Intelligence- based Assistants"" shall promote the scientific exchange on AI-based assistants for the Digital Economy.  The minitrack shall enable researchers to present and discuss innovative approaches, methodologies,  models, processes, etc., to design, implement, deploy, operate and optimize AI-based assistants for  the Digital Economy. The minitrack shall address also broader aspects such as platform and ecosystems  of AI-based platforms.  Focus of the Artificial Intelligence-based Assistants Minitrack  The AI-based assistants minitrack deals with the following topics, but contributions can also be  submitted on other topics.    Applications of AI-based assistants in the digital economy    Platforms and ecosystems of AI-based assistants     Methods and models to design, develop, implement, deploy, manage and monitor AI-based  assistants    Methods, tools, and approaches to capture the user behavior e.g., process mining and derive  recommendations for actions    New business models and processes based on AI-based assistants            Fundamental questions on the use of AI-based assistants    Research on the transparency of the behavior of AI-based assistants     Integration of AI-based assistants with services and platforms    Social and business implications of the use of AI-based assistants  Marketing plan  Based on the experiences of the last conference, the activities for directly addressing potential authors  will be intensified and the broad effect of further measures will be increased.   Direct contact with active authors  The  starting  point  is  an  intensive  search  for  authors  who  have  recently  published  at  related  conferences on minitrack topics. These authors will be contacted via e-mail and invited to submit their  work. Over 200 people were addressed for the 2021 event.  Leveraging the community  In order to improve the personal approach of potential authors, the chairs of the minitrack will  specifically activate multipliers in their communities. These will be used to address potential authors  in a targeted manner. The chairs of this minitrack proposal are in different program committees,  boards, etc. Therefore, a broad effect can be expected.   Website  In order to attract potential authors, a website will be set up that offers potential authors in-depth  information and explanations on the topic of AI-based assistants. Among other things, a bibliography  with publications on the topic of AI-based assistants will be offered.   Social Media  The chairs of the minitrack are integrated into a variety of social media networks (Twitter, Facebook,  LinkedIn, etc., through their other organizational activities. These are used for marketing the minitrack.  As a matter of course, all promotional activities provided by HICSS will be supported and integrated  into the marketing activities of the minitrack.

Domains include work related to detecting, mitigating, and preventing both internal and external human threats to organizational security. Papers may include theory development, empirical studies (both quantitative and qualitative), case studies, and other high-quality research manuscripts.  Topics include, but are not limited to: Creative investigations of actual user security behavior, both positive and negative Detecting and mitigating insider threats Security policy compliance research – motivations, antecedents, levers of influence Analysis of known and unknown modes and vectors of internal and external attack SETA (security education, training, and awareness) programs Modeling of security and privacy behavioral phenomena and relationships Merging methodological topics related to addressing research strategies in IS security Translational science perspectives and strategies for IS security research Theory development, theory building, and theory testing in information security Neurosecurity (NeuroIS) investigations of information security behavior Explorations of emerging issues related to the security of the “Internet of Things” (ioT)  This mintrack will provide IS/IT researchers a collaborative forum to share their research approaches. We hope to attract the skills and insights of scholars from a wide set of disciplines, presenting a mix of theoretical and applied papers on threats and mitigation. Areas of research may include the following.  1. Research related to insider threats to information security and privacy represent the first and most important thread for the minitrack. Insider threats include activities ranging from non-malicious and non-volitional behaviors (accidents and oversights) to volitional, but not malicious, actions to malicious actions such as theft, fraud, blackmail, sabotage, and embezzlement.  2. External vectors of attack by individuals and organizations outside the security perimeter represent the second thread for this minitrack. Specific topics of interest include hacker behaviors, cyber-warfare, identity theft (and electronic deception), and cyber-espionage, including most offensive and defensive methods of prevention, detection, and remediation. Other external parties are motivated to use IT to damage or steal trade secrets, national security information, sensitive account information, or other valuable assets.  3. A third thread revolves around security policy compliance, both at the individual and organizational level of analysis. Compliance is not merely a binary concept – it is a continuum. Individuals may minimally comply with formal security and privacy policies and procedures, or they may exhibit extra-role or stewardship behaviors that go above and beyond official compliance. Similarly, individuals may carelessly violate organizational security policies and procedures without malicious intent or they may attempt to cause maximum damage or loss.  4. Modeling and theory building in the context of IS security and privacy represents yet another interesting area. Theoretical development in information systems security and privacy research is immature relative to other areas of study in the information systems discipline. This sub-discipline of information systems continues to suffer from a limited theoretical base, restricting our collective ability to properly interpret reality, to apply appropriate methodological approaches, and to substantiate conclusions. Adaptation of theories from applied social psychology and criminology are particularly fertile areas for expanding our knowledge base in this domain. Theories from the disciplines of management, education, and others may also inform our understanding of the phenomena of interest.  5. Finally, we have a particular interest in emerging, rigorous research methods for investigating these phenomena. Organizational-level research can be improved, but studies conducted at the individual level, in particular, can benefit from new experimental designs and new data collection methods. Examples include neurophysiological (NeuroIS) methods such as EEG or fMRI, the factorial survey method, and simulations.  Important: each coauthor of a paper submitted to our mini-track is obligated to review at least one other paper for the mini-track. Failure of any one coauthor to review for the mini-track may result in the rejection of the coauthor's paper from the mini-track.  Marketing Plan for our Mini-Track  As in past years, my co-chairs and I will publicize our mini-track among the research community that focuses on behavioral research in Information Systems Security and Privacy.  We will not only post the CFP to AISWorld, but we will also distribute the CFP to four security-focused listservs (or email distributions), including CCREP, SOUP, AIS SIG-SEC, and IFIP WG 8.11/11.13.  We anticipate repeating our prior success in attracting sufficient high-quality papers to form three solid sessions of three papers each.  Statement of Support  My organization endorses my involvement and will pay for my travel and registration cost to attend HICSS.

Title of a Research track that this minitrack belongs    Internet and the Digital Economy1    2.  Description  of  a  minitrack  (If  your  proposal  is  accepted,  this  minitrack  description will be posted on the conference website and used as a Call for Papers  for your minitrack)    Among other promising technologies, Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), often  referred to as Blockchain, promise to be one of the most disruptive technologies since the  invention of the internet’s TCP/IP protocol. The combination of DLT characteristics such  as accountability, pseudonymity, or distributed network topology, as well as the first  cryptocurrency  Bitcoin,  drew  enormous  attention  given  the  ubiquitous  amount  of  possibilities for which this technology can be used since its invention in 2008 by Satoshi  Nakamoto. Whereas TCP/IP lowered the cost of transferring data between two parties  dramatically, DLTs have the potential to reduce the cost of transactions (i.e., transfer of  assets  and  value)  dramatically.  DLTs  can  enable  the  secure  transfer  of  any  asset  worldwide with nearly instant accountability by specifically cutting out intermediary trust  holders due to the capabilities of the network’s proof-of-X trust-building-processes, e.g.,  the Bitcoin proof-of-work mining concept. More recent developments built on top of  DLTs, like smart contracts and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), take  the possibilities of programmable secure transactions even further.    However, during the peak of inflated expectations, most DLT applications remained on a  conceptual level. Now, reaching the trough of disillusionment in the Gartner Hype Cycle,  DLT applications need to be put to the test to show the promised effects. Hence, this  minitrack welcomes research regarding methods and techniques, issues and critical  challenges, as well as organizational approaches for understanding the potential of DLTs  for business models, value chains, organizations, governance mechanisms, emerging  competitive landscapes, and new start-ups. Besides, submissions should address specific  industry  or  organizational  applications  and  focus  on  the  technology  layer,  strategic  organizational challenges, social implications about core values, and the socio-technical  perspective on governing organizations that use DLT. By opening this track to the IT,  economic/management  science,  and  IS  community,  we  foster  the  interdisciplinarity  needed to grasp the phenomenon from different perspectives. Topics of interest include,  but are not limited to:    ●  Applications  of  DLT  and  their  potential  in  different  areas  (e.g.,  insurance,  healthcare and pharmaceuticals, energy sector, manufacturing, transportation,  automotive industry, provenance, education, government sector)  ●  The Business implications of Blockchains and Internet of Things (e.g., machine- to-machine interaction, automated devices, DLT for metered appliances)  ●  The impact on business models (e.g., change of existing business models, the  emergence of new business models, disruptive business models)  ●  Organizational  transformation  through  DLT  (e.g.,  distributed  autonomous  organizations)  ●  Implications and challenges on governing and co-creating value in organizations  that use DLT    1 http://hicss.hawaii.edu/tracks-50/internet-and-the-digital-economy/  ●  Smart contracts and process automation in and between organizations, technology  adoption and diffusion  ●  The  impact  on  the  value  chain  (e.g.,  disintermediation,  change  of  actors,  advantages and disadvantages), the internet and the digital economy  ●  Regulatory aspects of Blockchains and implications for risk management  ●  Philosophical issues on the use of Blockchains (e.g., governance of blockchain  society, decentralization of society, change in core values, building of community  and collaboration)  ●  IT Management issues of Blockchains  ●  Blockchain Platforms and Ecosystems  ●  Blockchain Based Data Markets  ●  Blockchain Consortia    We are open to all methodological approaches such as case studies, surveys, experiments,  conceptual papers, and Design/Engineering research.         3.  Marketing Plan    The Technical University of Munich will cover the primary marketing for the minitrack  and utilize the University’s corporate communication center. With full access to both  classic and social media streams as well as a worldwide network, that the chairpersons  embody, there is no doubt that this track will catch the attention of a broad scientific  audience  as  well  as  media  coverage.  With  ties  to  the  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology (MIT) the chair will inform colleagues at MIT, BU, and Harvard through  various DLT and Blockchain mailing lists as well as faculty at MIT Sloan School of  Business. Further, TUM is currently founding a broader network of DLT and Blockchain  researchers  including  Prof.  Dr.  Philipp  Sandner,  Prof.  Dr.  Florian  Mattes  and  Dr.  Andranik Tumasjan which are all performing the groundwork on DLT and Blockchain  technology for the scientific community.    Giving the prominence of Blockchain technologies in newspapers and the attendance of  the minitrack sessions at the HICSS-52, 53, and 54, we expect this minitrack to receive a  sufficient number of papers. Nonetheless, we will also use the AIS forums and the  emergent network of Blockchain researchers as well as the Blockchain communities to  distribute the call. We also consider offering a tutorial on Blockchain at the HICSS that  will help create a HICSS Blockchain research community.     4.

Crow-based platforms include online labor markets  (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk, Freelancer.com), crowdsourcing platforms (e.g.,  Innocentive.com, Zhubajie.com), crowdfunding marketplaces (e.g., GoFundMe.com,  Indegogo.com), online communities (e.g., Facebook.com, Douban.com) and more  broadly, gig economy platforms (e.g., Uber, Lyft, AirBnB). The uprising scale and  importance of such platforms has revolutionized the digital economy.    Notably, these crowd-based platforms have attracted much research attention in  the IS field. The different types of crowd-based platforms offer new opportunities to  understand information systems and related problems, such as new product development  in crowdsourcing marketplaces (Huang et al. 2014); communication and coordination in  software development (Hong and Pavlou 2016); system design in online labor markets  (Hong et al. 2014; Liang et al. 2019); social influence of contribution patterns (Burtch et  al. 2013) in crowd funding marketplaces, etc. Hereby, more innovative research is  warranted in this research topic, given the scale and societal impact of these platforms.    In this minitrack, we seek to receive submissions of papers related to these three  types of platforms below, with topics including but not limited to the following. We also  welcome research using different data and methodologies, such as econometrics, field or  laboratory experimentation, analytical model, field surveys, qualitative analyses, or  theory-building approaches.    1  (1) Gig economy platforms  •  Ride sharing platforms (e.g., Uber/Lyft)  •  Lodge sharing platforms (e.g., Airbnb)  •  Online labor markets (e.g., Freelancer/Upwork/Guru/MTurk)  •  Ordering and delivery markets (e.g., Grubhub)  (2) Crowdfunding marketplace  •  Financial Technology (i.e., FinTech)  •  Algorithmic bias  •  Social capital  •  Funding success factors  (3) Two-sided matching markets  •  Platform equality  •  Market design  •  Information asymmetry   (4) Online communities  •  User-generated content  •  Incentives  •  User engagement    Marketing Plan  We have done extensive research and have identified a network of experts in the area of  crowd-based platforms. As minitrack chairs, we will personally invite leading researchers  in this area to submit to the minitrack. In addition, we will share the Call for Papers  (CFP) on multiple official listservs that majority of the IS and IS-related researchers  subscribe to, including AIS listserv, INFORMS ISS listserv. Further, we will promote the  minitrack and CFP information on social media, such as Facebook. The co-chairs are  connected with hundreds of IS researchers on Facebook. In fact, this proposed minitrack  has been successful in the past consecutive years, receiving more than twelve  submissions and accepting about six papers per year. Therefore, we hope to continue and  expand our marketing effort to promote this minitrack at HICSS.      2  Journal for Fast Track Opportunity  Data and Information Management (DIM)  (https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/dim/dim-overview.xml)    Bo-sketch of Minitrack Chair and Co-chairs    Minitrack Chair  Yili (Kevin) Hong     C.

Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining needed services and content by soliciting voluntary  contributions in the form of an open call from a large network of individuals rather than from an  organization’s employees or suppliers (Howe, 2006). For organizations, crowdsourcing provides  an online marketplace to tap into the labor and intelligence crowd. While crowdsourcing has been  found to potentially provide new opportunities for workers (Deng and Joshi, 2016; Taylor and  Joshi, 2019; Ma et al., 2018), others have identified the legal and regulatory challenges associated  with foster equitable, sustainable development through digital mediated work (Deng et al., 2016;  Taylor et al., 2020).     During the past decade, scholars from different disciplines have paid increasing attention to  examine the design and development of crowd-based platforms and the intelligence and innovation  arising from crowdsourced contests and competitions. Studies on the technical systems and  collective intelligence are informative, but our understanding of the crowdsourcing phenomenon  cannot be complete without a comprehensive understanding of the crowd itself, the work made  available on the digital platform, work conditions, and its institutional, regulatory and societal  impacts.     More broadly, crowdsourcing contributes to the growth of the gig economy, the labor market  characterized by the prevalence of short-term contracts or freelance work as opposed to permanent  jobs, enabled by on-demand apps such as Uber and TaskRabbit. A new kind of flexible structure  in the gig economy replaces the fixed employer-employee relationship in traditional organizations  (Gandini, 2019). While the new, flexible structure in gig work affords extreme flexibility, it is also  associated with instability in income and shifting of risks to workers.  For example, the platform  companies have shifted the operation risks from the employer to the worker because the platforms  do not provide workers with training, health or retirement benefits (Bajwa et al., 2018). With the  increasing concerns in the gig work and gig economy, it is important for both academia and policy  makers to understand the work conditions and the impact of gig work on workers.     Moreover, in the broad range of gig economy, workers from different types of platforms are likely  to experience different types of risks in gig work. Prior research (Heeks, 2017) distinguishes  between two types of gig work: one type is ”remote work” and the other is called ”place-based  work”. The former is geographically untethered (i.e., software coding and graphic design via  platforms such as Upwork or transcription via MTurk) while the latter is geographically specific  and performed locally by workers but may not be digitally intensive (i.e., ridesharing platforms  like Uber and Lyft, or delivery platforms such as Instacart and Postmates. Further research on  comparing remote gig work to placed-based gig work will generate useful insights.  1      Finally, it’s important for both academia and industry to better understand the impact of the- ongoing global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on work and workforce participating in both  remote and place-based gig work. In the long term, technological developments at the intersection  of crowdsourcing, gig work platforms and AI can potentially shape work at different levels.  Research on the future of work and the essential skills and abilities of future workforce will update  our knowledge and broaden our visions about the next generation of workforce.    Thus, this minitrack calls for research on the following three critical aspects of crowdsourcing and  gig work, including (1) work conditions for crowd workers, (2) the impact of crowdsourcing and  gig work, and (3) information technology and gig work. Papers presented at this HICSS-55  minitrack will be invited to extend and be fast tracked to the Journal of Organizational Computing  and  Electronic  Commerce  (JOCEC)  special  issue  on  Crowdsourcing  and  Gig  economy.    Potential issues and topics on crowd workers and digital workforce include, but are not limited to:  •  Employment relations in the gig economy  •  Ethical issues in the gig labor market and managing the gig workforce  •  Gig work and workers in the times of COVID-19  •  Gig work risk, worker behavior and performance  •  Gig workers’ participation, motivation and work-life balance  •  Gig work conditions  •  Global workforce in crowdsourcing and gig economy  •  Information technology and gig work  •  Labor agency in the gig labor market  •  Online communities of gig workers  •  Organizational and regulatory challenges in the gig economy  •  Psychological aspects of digital platforms on workers (e.g., Technostress, Well-being)  •  Regulatory oversight of gig work platforms and labor market  •  Skill development and career pathways of gig workforce  •  Technology advancement, AI and future of work     [2] Contact information for all minitrack chairs (please indicate the primary contact).

The worldwide spread of interconnected information and communication technologies (ICTs) has provided the infrastructure for multinational businesses, created new cultural connections irrespective of geographic boundaries and distances, and allowed an increasingly mobile global population to be connected to their friends, families, and cultures no matter where they are. Businesses across all sectors have been updating their business models to reap benefits from the advances in ICTs, which allowed many to extend their reach into global and international markets, and thus also into different cultural contexts.   In line with the track recognition that the Internet and the digital economy have transformed the way we work, learn, and play, our minitrack focuses on the sociotechnical dynamics and the ways in which the Internet, digitalization and the digital economy affect people, groups, organizations, and societies. We are in particular interested in the impact of global, international, and cross-cultural issues on the provision, use and also control of ICT services across the globe.  The minitrack welcomes submissions that relate to all aspects of information systems (IS) research situated in a global, international or cross-cultural context. The minitrack is open to all methodological approaches and perspectives. We are interested in empirical and theoretical work.  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:   The impacts of cultural values on ICT adoption and use, and control. The impacts of cultural aspects on digital maturity and opportunity recognition. Cross cultural studies of managing complex IT projects, especially for ICT development, and the quantification of self at work by individuals or organizations. Issues relating to globally distributed teams and global knowledge management. Issues relating to IT governance and IT security in global, international and cross cultural context. Issues relating to global distributed computing and Cloud sourcing strategies. Effects of global social computing on work organization and practices. The role of the digital skills gap and differences in the level of regulation and legislation across countries. Single country studies showing implications for other locations or results different from other contexts.  Marketing plan:  We will advertise the call for papers on several listservs and social media channels that will reach the information systems, information science and cognate communities. We plan to reach communities of scholars from business schools, iSchools, and information and computing communities around the globe. We would also publicize among various special interest groups of socio-technical researchers, social informatics and information science scholars. Additionally, we will personally invite researchers to submit their current work, who have been supporting this minitrack at previous editions.  Journals for fast track opportunities:  We will again offer 1-2 journals to fast-track best minitrack papers. To date, we have secured an agreement with the EIC from Information Systems Management.

The aim of this  minitrack is to offer a global perspective of how ICTs are being used, adopted, used and  diffused within society including households, enterprises of any size, government and social  communities.  ICTs  are  wide  ranging  from  the  infrastructure  of  Broadband  (high  speed  internet), to mobile devices, online social networks, sharing platforms, Artificial Intelligence,  Big Data Analytics, blockchain and other platforms enabled by the internet. Adoption, usage  and diffusion studies are prevalent in Information Systems (IS) research and offer an insight  into many issues surrounding ‘how’, ‘when’ and ‘what’ technologies are being introduced  and  their  impacts.  By  undertaking  this  stream  of  research,  academics,  industry  and  government  agencies  will  learn  of  how  ICTs  are  being  utilised  by  various  groups  and  communities in society and what measures are being undertaken to have households and the  various social communities adopt  and use the  ICTs  with  a further  consideration of the  impacts of the ICTs. Case studies, experiments, longitudinal and cross-sectional, snapshot  studies, literature reviews, empirical, comparative, and applied studies related to ICT use,  adoption, impacts and diffusion are emerging on a daily basis.     Therefore, topics and research areas included in this mini track are, but are not limited  to:  •  The adoption, use, impact and diffusion of any classic or innovative ICTs including  electronic commerce, social technologies, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Analytics,  blockchain, and Internet-of-Things within the society   •  Evaluation of the technological and non-technological aspects of the adoption and  usage of ICTs  •  Stakeholder theory application in the adoption, diffusion and usage of ICTs  •  The application of Resource Based theory and Co-creation concept when considering  the adoption, use, diffusion of ICTs  •  Human Computer Interaction issues associated with the adoption, usage and impact  factors in the context of ICTs  •  Economics of the adoption, use and diffusion of ICTs in society and in households  •  Working practices and their association with adoption, use and diffusion within  organizations  •  Resistance to change in the adoption, use and diffusion of ICTs within society and  organizations  •  Policies related to the adoption, use and diffusion of Broadband in societies and  households.  •  Conceptual studies of how a particular ICT is adopted and used within a specific  community  •  Empirical studies of the adoption and impact of ICTs in developing countries  •  Comparative studies of adoption, use and diffusion between demographic groups,  countries or regions  •  Studies of the digital divide that include the disabled and lower income families     Co-chairs:  Jyoti Choudrie (Primary Contact)   Management, Leadership and Organisation  Systems Management Research Unit  Hertfordshire Business School  University of Hertfordshire  DeHavilland Campus, Hatfield, AL10 9EU, UK  Email: j.choudrie@herts.ac.uk; Jyoti.choudrie@btopenworld.com    Sherah Kurnia  Computing and Information Systems  Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology  The University of Melbourne  Victoria, 3010  E-mail: sherahk@unimelb.edu.au    David Sundaram  Information Systems and Operations Management  Faculty of Business and Economics  The University of Auckland  Email: d.sundaram@auckland.ac.nz       Biographies of the mini-track chairs    Jyoti Choudrie is a Professor of Information Systems in University of Hertfordshire Business School, United  Kingdom.

At the same time, we face cognitive limitations, and our decisions are  influenced by various heuristics and biases, either for the good or bad. Research in  behavioral economics has acknowledged this bounded rationality and examines the  effects of psychological, cognitive, emotional, and social factors on judgment and  decision making of individuals and organizations.     As decisions are increasingly made in online environments, understanding economic  behavior in digital environments becomes ever more important. Behavioral economics  has reinforced the point that context matters when making judgments or decisions. Thus,  people’s decisions are not only influenced by the content of choices but also the  presentation of choices. That is, the decision environment’s design can “nudge” people  into certain behaviors. Coined by behavioral economists, “nudging” describes how even  minor changes to the decision environment influence choices, typically unnoticed by the  decision-maker (e.g., Thaler and Sunstein 2003; 2008)—a prominent example is setting  defaults (Johnson and Goldstein 2003). As any decision is influenced by the choice  environment—in both offline and online contexts—the presentation of choices will  always influence how people actually make their choices, both intentionally or  unintentionally.     As decisions are increasingly made online, the concept of “digital nudging” extends  “nudging” to the digital environment, referring to both the design and effects of nudges in  digital choice environments—i.e., the use of user-interface design elements to guide  people’s behavior on online platforms (Weinmann et al. 2016).    In addition to more common applications of nudges—such as by setting defaults in online  forms—online interactions present other unique opportunities for nudging users. For  example, if a user shows abnormal behavior suggesting she is likely to abandon an online  interaction, a website can dynamically present a nudge to keep her on the site. Further,  websites can track and analyze user behavior in real-time and dynamically present  personalized content; in combination, website designers can use these capabilities to test  and optimize the effectiveness of digital nudges. Given these advantages, information  systems allow rapid content modification and visualization to create adaptive user  interfaces that help to achieve the desired outcomes (Schneider et al., 2018).    The main purpose of this mini-track is to explore and extend, as well as exchange,  research related to behavioral economics & nudging in the context of information  systems design, and the digital economy. Specifically, this mini-track aims to examine  the design, main applications, and effects of digital nudging in information systems  design, in particular, research with an emphasis on the effects of interface design on  users’ behavior, judgment, and decision making in Internet-based systems. We welcome  papers that draw on or combine behavioral research methods (e.g., experimentation,  survey, case study, action research) and design science approaches.    Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:    •  Applications of behavioral economics concepts to information system design  •  Design of online choice architectures  •  Information processing for decision making   •  Influence of information presentation on consumption behavior (for example,  feedback mechanisms in website design and sustainable behaviors)  •  Framing effects in website design  •  Impact of anchoring effects on online judgment and decision making   •  Impact of behavioral economics principles and website design implementation on  privacy and trust  •  Issues related to behavioral design principles and security   •  Impact of website design on loss aversion and risk perception/evaluation  •  Impact of digital nudges on online judgment and decision making  •  Website designs/elements that encourage rational thinking and/or nudge users into  certain behaviors  •  Issues related to dynamic website design and interactive decision making   •  Website design and preference building effects  •  Cognitive, emotional, and social factors and information systems design  •  Applications of behavioral economics principles in online platforms that influence  users’ behaviors (for example, in online auctions and e-marketplaces, crowdfunding  platform, mobility platforms, and others)  •  Ethical issues of digital nudging    Marketing the Mini-Track:    Within the IS community, interest in the topic of digital nudging has increased  considerably in the past few years (further raised since Richard Thaler was awarded the  Nobel prize in economics for his research on nudging in 2017). We expect a good  number of quality submission, and we will actively promote the mini-track through the  following channels:  (1) A network of international colleagues will support the mini-track both in terms of  promotion and editorial services  (2) We will promote the mini-track through the AIS listserv as well as on social media  (Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter in particular).  (3) We will directly promote the mini-track to participants of the past nudging mini- tracks, as well as nudging researchers in the wider IS community.  (4) The primary co-chair has established strong connections with nudging researchers in  the judgement and decision-making community (SJDM); we will directly promote the  mini-track to members of this community.  (5) The HCI mini-track has also created relationships with the AIS-Transactions on HCI  for possible fast track opportunities for the best papers of the mini-track. These  relationships to journals add to the appeal of our mini-track.       Bios:     Markus Weinmann is an assistant professor at Rotterdam School of Management,  Erasmus University.

Supply chains have to cope with increasingly dynamic customer demands and a broad variety of external disturbances. More flexibility and agility are needed, processes have to be accelerated and made transparent or visible in order to enhance supply chain responsiveness, resilience and sustainability. Innovative technological solutions such as the Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems, autonomous or collaborative robots, automated guided vehicles and drones, cloud and mobile computing, data analytics and machine learning, artificial intelligence, digital platforms and blockchain as well as virtualization of the physical world and additive manufacturing can help to master the challenges and are increasingly being used in practice. The implementation of these technologies may lead to a fundamental digital transformation of companies, supply chains and industry structures. Data has to be understood as a new source of value creation. The technologies mentioned above in combination with data-driven services pave the way for a paradigm shift in supply chain management, leading to more self-organizing and self-optimizing ecosystems. In this minitrack we try to understand how digital transformation effects traditional product-oriented supply chains as well as the corresponding management activities and thus leads to the digital supply chain of tomorrow. Digitalization in general is expected to play an increasingly important role for global supply chains. The reasons for this include: the shift in values from the physical artefact to the data created by smart products, the emerging importance of digital platforms, services and business ecosystems, the displacement of industry borders, the radical change of competitive structures and power distribution, the transformation of business models and, at the end of the day, the symptomatic destruction of established structures and behavior patterns. This minitrack provides an outlet for all research focused on digital transformation of supply chains. Its focus is not primarily on pure technologies but on their applications and implications with regard to the dominant logic of supply chain configurations and value creation in a supply chain management (SCM) context. We are also interested in the driving forces for a digital transformation and the instruments and tools to master the change or to measure its progress. Therefore, we welcome research in progress or completed research papers that address applications, use cases, theories, models, methods, tools as well as other critical issues, including but not limited to: Drivers of digital transformation in supply chains Supply chain structures for smart products and smart services Visibility and transparency through the Internet of Things Company-spanning data spaces for supply chain and business ecosystem management    Improved planning and forecasting through big data analytics and predictive analytics Decision-making based on artificial intelligence Virtualization of supply chain structures (digital twin etc.) Robots, cobots and other technology drivers for process automation in supply chains Robotic Process Automation (RPA)  Role of digital platforms in supply chain structures Role of service providers (logistics, IT, communication etc.) in future supply chain structures Contribution of blockchain technologies to supply chain management The impact of 3D printing on value creation systems The impact of digitalization on business models and business performance  Changes in the understanding of the terms Supply Chain, SCM, Ecosystem Models, methods and tools for the digitalization of companies and supply chains Barriers and challenges for the digitalization of supply chains Legal frameworks for the digitalization of supply chains Relationship between data security and digitalization of supply chains Requirements for the digitalization of supply chains in the extended enterprise Relationship management in digital supply chains Contributions of digitalization to “green” sustainable supply chains Emerging technologies’ applications in last-mile deliveries Marketing plan: Chairs and Co-chairs will send the minitrack to the global research communities for Logistics, SCM and Business Informatics as well as to their personal research networks directly after publication. Experts on “digital supply chains” within the different research communities will be identified and addressed personally. The experts will be asked to forward the minitrack proposal to other relevant researchers in order to create a pyramiding effect. National and international research projects on digitalization will be identified and the research teams will be asked for contributions. Multiple reminders will be sent in order to increase the response flow.

These may include papers on – strategies or tools helping  companies to deal with their digital transformation; practices involved in digital transformation; challenges  during the transformation process; metrics and indicators adopted to measure the success or degree of  digital transformation; or other relevant topics in the area.   Proposed topics include, but are not limited to:  •  DT challenges, drivers, adoption, and barriers  •  DT human resources / technology / corporate strategies  •  DT key performance indicators / success factors / maturity  •  Comparisons between industries and countries  •  Impact on work and changing roles e.g. Data Scientists, Data Citizens, Chief Digital Officers etc.  •  Frameworks of analyses such as dynamic capabilities, disruption, competitive advantage  •  Methodological reflections such as sociotechnical / sociomaterial approaches or design science  approaches  Research questions, some examples include (but are not limited to):  •  How to prepare middle managers for digital transformation?   •  How to measure the degree of DT?  •  What are strategies to better cope with challenges of DT?  •  How does DT affect corporate strategy and vice versa?  •  How does analytical competence and capability influence DT?  •  Which methodological lenses are needed to come to a higher level of theorization of DT?  •  How to adapt change management to better support successful DT?  •  How does data-driven business and DT influences business models?  •  How existing business are facing DT of the supply chain and partners?   •  How digital supply chain compels organizations to embark in the digital transformation journey?    We expect contributions that will address relevant research questions to the DT process and business model  changes. Exchanges and interactions among authors during the conference will promote fruitful discussions,  perhaps new collaborations. As DT draws heavily from related research domains and seems to be under- theorized in itself, this minitrack will contribute to some theoretical evolution of this relevant research topic.    Journals  for  fast-track  opportunities:  We  are  planning  to  organize  a  special  issue  for  the  Information Systems Frontiers journal   Marketing plan: Similar to the HICSS2019, HICSS2020 and HICSS2021 we will share the minitrack call through  personal contacts and newsletters, as well as through established contact with former track participants. In  addition, we will employ our network from other conferences (e.g., ECIS and AMCIS), in which we are co- chairing other minitracks. We will publish the call and the introduction to the minitrack on Researchgate and  in other lists. Also, we will use Linked-In to distribute our call.

Weinberg (Primary Contact), Lenita M. Davis, Ajit Kambil    Our organizations endorse our involvement and will pay for our travel and registration cost to attend HICSS.    This proposal is for a minitrack on Electronic Marketing with two to four sessions to attract traditional  empirical research and more forward looking, innovative and applied research under the track of ""Internet and the  Digital Economy."" Our experience with this minitrack for the past sixteen years has been extremely positive,  attracting numerous excellent papers and a best paper award winner in the Internet and the Digital Economy track,  and publishing some of them in special issues of the e-Service Journal, and the Journal of Marketing Analytics. We  would appreciate the opportunity to advance the contribution of this minitrack. Electronic Marketing has evolved  and grown to a point where many interesting theoretical and empirical works have been done to explore many of its  facets. The proposed session(s) are for emergent and innovative applications, and empirical research. Some of the  papers presented in this minitrack over the years have been on emergent topics/areas that later proved to be highly  impactful, such as online shopping, online auctions, online word of mouth, online rating systems, social media, co- creation, “smart” systems, internet of things, digital voice assistants, and the like. We believe that this minitrack will  continue to attract papers on established and emerging domains.    Emergent And Innovative Applications  This session will accept submissions that are on emergent, and more forward looking, innovative technologies  and topics that are well conceptualized and thought through. In recent years marketing has been dramatically  transformed by information technologies and innovations, such as point of sale, customer relationship management,  platforms, social media, data mining, text mining, mobile devices, self/behavioral-measurement tools, internet of  things, digital voice assistants, artificial intelligence, and autonomous systems. Emerging technologies (e.g.,  artificial intelligence, internet of things, autonomous systems) and implementations (e.g., platforms, customer  experience management) are transforming consumer behavior, commerce, organizational strategy and behavior,  societal culture, the meaning of being, and more.  For this session, there is great interest in a wide range of emergent and novel technologies and topics that are, or  may be in, the midst of transforming the marketing landscape. In addition, we  highlight a special interest in  attracting submissions related to electronic-marketing related experiences, such as customer experiences and  customer experience management, product experiences, and brand experiences. The intent of this emphasis is to  attract submissions related to experiences, and not to squelch out submissions on other emergent and novel topics, as  all such topics are welcome with great interest.  Submissions may focus on theory, strategy, cases, practices, methods, or anything else compelling and of great  interest to marketers and the HICSS community. However, it is key that  each submission convey a sense of  significant importance, richness, or impact for theory, behaviors, or/and practice.    Empirical research session  Companies marketing and selling their goods and services with digital technologies face a variety of issues,  such as how to attract customers, retain customers, communicate to/with consumers and customers, promote  products, price products, build brands, learn more about customers, collaborate with various stakeholders, distribute  products, earn trust, define and deliver on privacy, and the like. There are a number of important or unique  challenges and factors for effectively planning and performing in markets that are engaged in digital, web-based and  other technology-based environments/contexts.  Empirical research in electronic marketing has covered a diverse number of topics including consumer  behavior, branding, advertising, pricing, word of mouth, ratings and reviews, pricing, and so on. This minitrack  emphatically welcomes and invites submissions that describe rigorous, interesting, and informative empirical studies  including experimental and quasi-experimental ones, field studies, and so on. There is a great range of  topics in  electronic marketing that we believe can be addressed as part of this minitrack session, such as customer acquisition,  retention, consumer behavior, communication and promotion, product strategy and tactics, branding, channels,  retailing and distribution, trust, privacy, social media, internet of things, voice, video, etc.  In addition, this minitrack wants research/manuscripts that present empirical studies employing new and  interesting methodologies, or demonstrating new experimental procedures, new measurement instruments, data    1  analysis, and innovative experimental manipulations that can greatly benefit other empirical researchers. We invite  submissions of experiments, field studies, and other empirical work. Manuscripts can cover a variety of electronic  marketing topics.  Am important key is that the research/manuscripts be rigorous and contribute new and interesting insights into  the area of electronic marketing.    Short description of the minitrack including topics  Firms continue learning how to more effectively market digitally and with electronic media and related  technologies. There are a variety of important issues and topics of importance, such as effective strategies for  attracting, engaging, and retaining customers, methods and theory related to increasing purchase, satisfaction and  loyalty, processes for enhancing the customer experience, methods for better leveraging channels, consumer  behavior and use of information, social media, and, indeed, more. This minitrack wants to showcase meaningful and  impactful research in a variety of electronic marketing domains, including emergent and innovative technologies and  topics. Research could be wide ranging, such as rich descriptive statistics of online customer/consumer behavior,  theories, emergent and innovative topics, models and frameworks related to technologies and their impact on  marketing, case studies, methods, qualitative research, etc.    Marketing – post on appropriate listservs, and via email.

The aim of this mini-track is to provide a forum for HCI researchers to discuss a broad range of issues related to the design of user interfaces. Appropriate papers for the HCI mini-track may draw on a wide spectrum of research methodologies including, but not limited to, behavioral methods (e.g., case study, experimentation, survey, action research), neurophysiological tools (e.g., fMRI, eye tracking, skin conductance response, and input devices such as the computer mouse, touch screen and typing dynamics), and design science approaches. Accordingly, papers may draw on various reference disciplines to inform design, such as computer science, information systems, consumer behavior, psychology, organizational sciences, and neuroscience. Moreover, papers that help to bridge academic research and industry practice are welcome.   Given the diverse goals of this mini-track, there are many appropriate topics; possible topics include, but are not limited to:  Analysis, design, development, evaluation, and use of information systems  Guidelines and standards for interface design Web-based user interface design and evaluation  Design and evaluation issues for mobile devices and m-Commerce Interface design for FinTech applications  Interface design for group and other collaborative environments  Design issues related to the elderly, the young, and special needs populations Interface issues in the design and development of innovative interaction technologies Novel forms of authentication and authorization (e.g., using mousing or typing dynamics) Using information and sensors to detect user states (e.g., emotion, cognitive conflict) and create more intelligent interfaces The impact of interfaces on attitudes, emotion, perception, behavior, productivity, and performance Implications and consequences of technological change on individuals, groups, society, and socio-technical units  Behavioral, neurophysiological, and design aspects of human-computer interaction Neuroscientific approaches to human-computer interaction Factors influencing usability (i.e., friction reduction), ease-of-use and the overall user experience Information systems usability engineering Issues related to teaching HCI courses   Track Justification: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a dynamic field that has attracted researchers, educators, and practitioners from various disciplines. HCI has gained attention during recent years due to the rapid development and advancement in information and computer technology. To better interact with and use advanced technology, we need to better understand users, their tasks within different contexts, and the interplay among users, tasks, and contexts/environments.     In a variety of computing disciplines, HCI issues and research questions have been investigated over a long period of time. HCI or Human Factors studies in the information systems discipline, for example, have been concerned with the ways humans interact with information, technologies, and tasks, especially in business, managerial, organizational, and cultural and social contexts. There is a natural overlap between HCI design issues within organizational contexts and a broad range of other contexts (e.g., education, e-government, health care, and so on).   The high level of interest exhibited by HCI scholars as well as practitioners is evidenced in many ways:   The HCI mini-track was first introduced at HICSS-40 and has continued to attract high quality papers and an interested audience. Given the apparent interest and demand for HCI research at HICSS, we expect a similar number of submissions for the HCI mini-track next year. Due to the increased interest in HCI research, the AIS Journal of Transactions in Human-Computer Interaction (THCI) has asked the co-chairs to forward papers from the HICSS-54 for fast tracking possibilities. With the primary co-chair serving as SE for THCI, we expect the same for HICSS-55.  The high-level participation in HCI specific events sponsored by the AIS SIGHCI (please refer to http://sighci.org/ for more information). The high level of participation in the HCI mini-tracks/tracks at AMCIS and ICIS 2002 – 2020, sponsored by AIS SIGHCI.  HCI research has become a major focus at research conferences for a variety of disciplines and professional societies (e.g., IEEE, ACM, AIS).    Marketing the Mini-Track:  The HCI research community has grown substantially in the past several years. Due to this growth we have successfully marketed this mini-track using the following channels: The AIS HCI Special Interest Group (SIG) has a biannual newsletter in which the HCI mini-track will be prominently featured. The HCI mini-track will also be featured on the SIG-HCI webpage. An email database of past authors and reviewers of the HCI mini-track has been compiled and will be used to advertise a call for papers. The HCI mini-track has also created relationships with the AIS-Transactions on HCI for possible fast track opportunities for the best papers of the mini-track. These relationships to journals add to the appeal of our mini-track.     Further, given the broad interest in HCI research, we intend to publish the call for papers (CFP) for this mini-track widely to attract both a good mix of HCI-oriented researchers as well as a wide range of other contributors including practitioners (e.g., Web designers and developers) and academics from other disciplines (e.g., HCI, Information Sciences, Applied Psychology, Neuroscience). We believe that the diversity of contributors will help facilitate cross-fertilization of research ideas and enhance the advancement of the field.

Not only the economies and the societies but also people’s personal lives have been influenced by this new and ever-emerging era of our history. While the digital age has made it possible to provide novel services and solutions for the end-users, it has also caused serious concerns in different individual and societal levels, such as issues regarding online privacy, algorithmic bias, fairness and accountability of information systems, transparency, governance, and explainability of information systems, end-user manipulations, fake news, traceability, etc. The development of human-centric and end-user empowering information systems can be one approach towards “digital sustainability” since they enable individuals to influence how their data is used, by whom, and for which purpose. Many novel and personalized services are emerging in this direction, which make the digital economy sustainable, i.e. a positive place that focuses on human users.   This minitrack aims to attract research that advances the understanding of human-centricity and end-user empowerment in a sustainable digital economy. As the transformation is multidimensional in nature, the minitrack adopts an interdisciplinary perspective, which considers human-centricity and end-user empowerment across application domains (e.g. software development, digital commerce, healthcare, administration, mobile apps, social media, and online services) and disciplines (e.g. economics, computer science, sociology). Among the relevant topics are: Characteristics and design of sustainable human-centric information systems Evaluation of existing information systems from a human-centric perspective Co-creation and co-production of human-centric sustainable information systems Analysis and design of technologies (e.g. AI, Blockchain) that empower end-users Design of human-centric end-user agents, AI and machine learning Fairness, transparency, accountability and controllability of information systems Legal or economic aspects of human-centricity in information systems Identity, privacy and consent management systems   Business value of human-centric and/or user empowered solutions Sociotechnical studies of human-centricity in information systems Opportunities and challenges of digital behavior change, habit formation, and digital addiction Digital nudging for increasing social or ecological responsibilities Ethical concerns regarding human-centricity and/or sustainability COVID-19’s impact on human-centricity or sustainability of information systems Publication of Papers HICSS is the #1 Information Systems conference in terms of citations as recorded by Google Scholar.

This has led to the development  of smart machines that use technologies generally referred to as the Internet of Things  (IoT); additionally the emerging area Internet of Nano Things (IoNT) is set to replace the  traditional use of IoT in health and utility equipment and software applications. IoT is a  paradigm utilizing the internet to transform real-world objects into smart objects that have  autonomous capabilities to organize, adapt, and communicate. Similarly, IoNT is a type  of IoT where interconnected nanodevices are used to create smart objects.  In fact,  nanoscale devices and systems characterized with their size of 100 nanometer have  allowed the development of Internet of nanothings (IoNT) which allow us to develop  interconnectivity  of  nanoscale  devices  over  the  internet  and  other  communication  networks. According to marketwatch.com the global Internet of Nanothings (IoNT) market  is projected to reach $5.43 billion by the end of 2022, growing at a rate of 21.89% during  2020-2022.  One of the key promises of IoNT is to create globally interconnected network with the  inclusion of real-life objects. A world with intelligent devices offers enormous promise to  design and develop a smart society and implementation of new and improved business  processes; however, these innovations may impose security and privacy threats and  technical challenges. To understand the full potential of IoNT innovations and trends  requires that we as researchers seek not only technical solutions but also address  corresponding organizational and socio-political threats and the way we manage them.  Policies  and  frameworks  related  to  the  IoNT  paradigm  are  critically  important  for  individuals,  organizations,  and  government  and  a  greater  understanding  of  these  emerging technological trends is required to address these threats.  We are seeking high-quality research papers for this track that investigate technological,  managerial and policy innovation in the area of IoNT technologies, IoNT project  management, and IoNT applications in areas such as business, health, infrastructure,  and smart metering in the utility industry. Possible topics include, but are not limited to:  •  Leveraging IoNT capabilities to create a smart world.  •  Theory and characteristics of IoNT solutions  •  IoNT and Big data, data analytics and visualization   •  IoNT and the application of artificial intelligence/ML both as a service and on the  edge  •  Design and development of IoNT systems and architectures   •  Project management techniques in the context of smart devices and sytems.  •  Privacy, security, social, and ethical issues due to the emergence of IoNT.      Marketing Plan   We performed a systemic literature survey involving top IS conferences and Journals and  have the database of various researchers who are publishing in the IoT/IoNT area. We  will contact them via email and invite them to submit their research in this minitrack.

OSN  are  increasingly  being  used  to  obtain  information,  opinions,  recommendations, and comparisons and to view discussions to make shopping decisions.  Often  consumers are faced with purchase dilemmas and there are many questions in one’s mind that could  potentially affect the outcome of the purchase decision.   With the ubiquity of recommender and comparison systems in Online Social Shopping engines and  multi-sided platforms like Amazon, Alibaba, eBuy, Buy.com, and Facebook, more studies are appearing  with regard to online information search fueling the purchasing power of shoppers. Online social media  such as blogs, wikis, forums, and social networks are significantly impacting the shopping behaviours in  all demographics.   How shopping decisions are taken with the support of OSN and how these networks influence purchase  behavior has not been explored sufficiently in research. Although the usage of OSN is growing rapidly,  there is a poor understanding of how OSN can provide support and influence purchase decisions in  general.   The objective of this mini-track is to obtain insights and develop theoretical and practical understanding  on topics and issues related to the influence of OSN on consumption orientated shopping decisions.   We welcome conceptual, theoretical, and empirical papers that enrich our understanding of OSN and  its design and how they support, influence and manipulate shopping decisions. All methodological  approaches are welcome.    Topics of interest in the context of social shopping include but are not limited to:  •  Shopping Decision Making and Decision Support  •  Co-creation of value on multisided platforms  •  Group shopping sites, communities and marketplaces  •  Influence, persuasion, and peer pressure  •  Market manipulation and incentives  •  Advertising, marketing and recommender systems   •  e-commerce, mobile commerce, and social commerce  •  Shopping gamification and shopping games   •  Consumerism,  compulsive and addictive shopping   •  Fraud, deception, governance, risk, compliance, security and privacy   •  Gen-X, Y, Z, millennial shopping  •  Age, gender, and demographics  •  OSN post purchase cognitive dissonance   •  Processes, systems, tools and technologies to support social shopping          Mini-track Chairs:    Gabrielle Peko – Primary contact   Gabrielle Peko is a faculty member at the Department of Information Systems and Operations  Management, University of Auckland Business School.

"HICSS-54","KS","Knowledge Innovation and Entrepreneurial Systems","961d5300-d980-433c-9ea1-92c8804edbf1","The Technical, Socio-Economic and Ethical Aspects of AI","Proposed Mini-track for HICSS-55:   The Technical, Socio-Economic and Ethical Aspects of AI  Under the track: Knowledge Innovation and Entrepreneurial Systems  [1] Description of a minitrack (If your proposal is accepted, this minitrack description will be posted on the conference website and used as a Call for Papers for your minitrack.)  Augmented Intelligence is a new perspective to look at the artificial intelligence, social computing, machine learning, big data, data mining, and related areas. It describes a system that consists of both artificial intelligence agents and human agents. Compared to the traditional AI whose ultimate goal is to replicate human intelligence, Augmented Intelligence aims to augment human intelligence which includes not only the cognitive intelligence, but also emotional intelligence, social intelligence, physical intelligence and so on. It has a clear emphasis that humanity, not machines, is the core of this scientific inquiry. In recent years, more and more practitioners and researchers start to accept this more holistic view of AI and to demonstrate that the ultimate goal of AI is not to replace human but to augment human. Augmented Intelligence describes a hybrid system not only the artificial intelligence agents, but also the human agents, therefore opening up new research opportunities not only for researchers in technical areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data, and data mining, but also for researchers in behavioral science, social science, organization science, human-computer interaction and many other areas.  1.1 The Technical Aspect of AI The technological advancements in computer science and information systems have presented AI as a new type of aid to human workers. AI can automate simple, repetitive tasks and allow human workers to work on creative tasks. In the business setting, by applying machine learning to natural language processing (NLP), AI can help its human counterparts improve the workflows in sales and customer sales management by analyzing the tone of voice and verbiage used on a call. The International Data Corporation (IDC) forecasts that AI will unleash unprecedented levels of workplace productivity, boost global revenues by $121 billion over the next five years and generate more jobs than it will replace. In healthcare, AI assists radiologists with image interpretation by bringing the relevant information out of the electronic medical record and presenting it to them in a meaningful way to better inform their clinical judgment. AI also facilitates innovations and the creation of intellectual products. For example, a paper published in this mini-track in 2021 (Li, Xie & Sha, 2021) studies how to use deep generative network (GAN) to assist human engineers to come up with innovative car designs that also have optimized aerodynamic performance.  1.2 The Socio-Economic Aspect of AI Nowadays business practitioners have increasing scrutiny on socio-economic aspects of AI and exploring new opportunities through innovation spillovers. For instance, AI, used in combination with experienced farmers, could prevent unpredictability of weather or soil conditions, thereby reducing farmers’ costs and boosting profits. In the financial sector, AI robot-enabled service helps consultants to complete repetitive tasks, allowing them to concentrate on more judgement-based proceeding and customer service. As the needs for social computing, continues to grow, researchers should continue to study how AI can drive the digital economy while at the same time satisfying human’s needs by offering solutions to societal issues. AI is also enhanced by a novel computing paradigm, the social computing. Social computing artifacts such as social media, blog, social bookmarking, and wiki generates enormous amount of data, the “big data,” which enhances the human intelligence in acquiring, assimilating, and/or sharing (i.e., storage/retrieval, transmission features) social information. It also provides valuable training data set for the artificial intelligence agents. AI will continue to pervade people’s everyday work life and personal life. In the workplace, people will see more and more AI software programs and AI-enabled robots as their teammates. In people’s personal life, AI assistant such as Siri, Amazon Echo & Alexa, Google assistant, AI-enabled smart home are becoming a significant member of people’s family. The human-AI interaction, human-AI collaboration, the trust are important research topics in these contexts. Several important questions such as “how to integrate human skills and intelligence with AI to facilitate human-AI symbiosis?” and “how to train AI agents to correspond with human competencies?” remain unsolved.  1.3 The Ethical Aspect of AI Ethical concerns have arisen in the development and deployment of artificial intelligence systems. Computer and data scientists have or will encounter ethical issues such as biases in the building of machine learning models and stereotypes in the development of robots. For example, how can we ensure if a training data for a machine learning model is unbiased? What are the defining scopes, measurements, and prevention strategies of biases during the development and deployment of an AI system? How can human values be imported and accounted for in a fair manner in the design of AI systems? Value sensitive design is a value-oriented design methodology commonly adopted in human–computer interaction; it seeks to understand how human values (e.g., welfare, accountability, autonomy, freedom from bias) can be accounted for in the design of computer technologies; . While Augmented Intelligence brought us the promising prospect to use the power of machine learning to uncover creative insights in fields such as science and healthcare, it’s important for us to consider and incorporate human values in the design of AI systems. Value sensitive design framework has been proposed in the ethical considerations of micro-task crowdsourcing platform design . Likewise, we should not underestimate the potential ethical concerns arising in the adoption and use of AI for intelligence augmentation. Researchers should continue to study how to avoid the risk of constructing machine intelligence that mirrors a narrow and privileged vision of society with its biases and stereotypes.  1.4 Potential Topics  This mini-track welcomes papers in all formats including empirical studies, design, theory, theoretical framework, case studies, and etc. In addition to the perspectives above, this minitrack welcomes any studies that investigate Augmented Intelligence from both technical perspectives and social behavioral perspectives.   Potential topics include, but are not limited to: AI and social computing AI, big data and business analytics AI and knowledge management AI, digital inclusion and social inclusion AI and future of work AI in digital economy AI in healthcare Human–AI hybrids  Trust towards AI and robots Users’ fear of AI Robots and the impacts on workplace Biases in machine learning models and best practices Biases in robotics and best practices Business applications of AI systems Value-Sensitive Design (VSD) and AI system design Ethical issues in AI development Ethical issues in AI adoption and use Organizational adoption and use of AI Regulations and public policies related to AI   [2] Contact information for all minitrack chairs (please indicate the primary contact).

"HICSS-54","KS","Knowledge Innovation and Entrepreneurial Systems","f55c40ae-9987-4a19-9554-c0b20ed6f988","Illuminating the Dark Side of Knowledge","Title of a minitrack: Illuminating the Dark Side of Knowledge Research track: Knowledge Innovation and Entrepreneurial Systems Description of a minitrack:  Information systems of various kinds have been transforming how individuals, communities and organizations create, share and consume information and knowledge with each other and with firms (Kietzmann, Hermkens, McCarthy, & Silvestre, 2011). At an exciting time of rapid technological advancements (e.g., of AI, cognitive computing), many studies highlight the “bright side” of knowledge and the systems used to manage it. Examples include how social media democratize engagement between firms and consumers or how firms can improve public relations, customer service, product development, or personnel decision making. None of these business activities are imaginable anymore without systems involvement. Regardless of the numerous opportunities that knowledge and information systems offer, there is undoubtedly a “dark side” that holds enormous risks for individuals, communities, organizations and even whole societies (Baccarella, Wagner, Kietzmann, & McCarthy, 2018). The recently coined term “surveillance capitalism” (Zuboff, 2019) illustrates how governments and corporations can leverage knowledge and systems to invade privacy (Pai & Arnott, 2013), use fake news (Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017; European Commission, 2018) and trolling (Buckels, Trapnell, & Paulhus, 2014; Hardaker, 2010) to manipulate and deceive. Deepfakes and GANs are even more compelling applications of AI/deep learning technologies that have been used extensively to deceive people (Kietzmann et al, 2020). Conversely, others have explored concerns such as cyberbullying (O’Keeffe & Clarke-Pearson, 2011), addictive use (Blackwell, Leaman, Tramposch, Osborne, & Liss, 2017), and collective consumer efforts to realize market value unintended by the firm (Campbell and Schau 2019). Beyond issues regarding how individuals and organizations might inappropriately exploit access to knowledge, there is the ""curse of knowledge,"" a cognitive bias that occurs when an informed individual wrongly assumes that others have the background to understand an issue (Heath and Heath, 2006) or is unable to ignore more knowledge (Camerer, Loewenstein, and Weber, 1989). Therefore, despite the many benefits promised, the significant negative or detrimental consequences of knowledge and information systems are worthy of research attention. Further theoretical as well as empirical work is needed to better understand this dark side. Thus, the aim of this minitrack is to improve understanding of the so far largely neglected dark side of knowledge by encouraging researchers from a variety of fields to share their work. The dark side of knowledge has implications for individuals, communities, organizations and many aspects of society, thus we do not limit the mini-track to specific stakeholder groups or themes. Potential topics and underlying research questions may include but are not limited to: Theories, models and classification frameworks that shed light on the dark side of knowledge. Methods for studying the dark side of knowledge and its impact on individuals, communities and organizations, and on many aspects of society. Understanding how individuals, communities and organizations can minimize, prevent or respond to the dark side of knowledge. Understanding what motivates individuals, communities and organizations to deliberately engage in dark side behaviours and practices. Examining dark side outcomes, behaviours and practices that accidently or unintentionally emerge. Approaches to lobbying, regulating and controlling dark side behaviours and practices. Region, sector and industry-focused studies on the dark side of knowledge. Specific phenomena, including but not limited to surveillance capitalism, fake news, online bullying, conspiracy, hashtag hijacks, reputation blackmail, online firestorms, tweet-up disasters, activities on the darknet/dark web/deep web. Marketing plan: The team of mini-track chairs include Jan Kietzmann (Information Systems), Constantine S. Katsikeas (Management), and Hope Jensen Schau (Marketing). We each will promote this mini-track in our respective networks, through personal contacts and American Marketing Association (AMA), Association for Consumer Research (ACR), Consumer Culture Theory Consortium (CCTC), and Academy of Marketing Science (AMS).

If your proposal is accepted, we will use this description on the HICSS-website.  The goal of the Judgement, Big Data-Analytics and Decision-making mini-track is to monitor and advance our knowledge of the convergent technologies of Big Data and analytics and their role in augmenting knowledge for better management decision-making. The emphasis of the track is on the humanistic aspects of knowledge innovation, by investigating how data-analytics, and big data analytics in particular, can be used to support human judgement and organizational knowledge.  Gathering, analyzing and judging reliable data and information, and more importantly, transforming them into actionable knowledge is becoming increasingly critical in decision-making (Intezari & Gressel, 2017; Nicolas, 2004; Abedin et al, 2018). Human judgement, based on experience and knowledge, plays an important role in all facets of decision-making, but may be incomplete in certain decision situations. The study of the transformation of data into useful information and eventually knowledge and wisdom through the use of increasingly sophisticated analytics for management decision making is an important, emerging field of research (Pauleen & Wang, 2017) and deserves further study.  b) Names and full mailing address, direct phone number, departmental phone number and fax, email addresses for all minitrack chairs.

Include the title of the proposed minitrack. Include a marketing plan; adequate publicity is a crucial element in a successful minitrack.  This mini track welcomes empirical research adopting quantitative, qualitative and design science methodologies, as well as conceptual papers that offer significant  theoretical insights into the human- and knowledge-centric aspects of analytics, big data and decision-making. While technology plays a centric role in the research relevant to this mini-track, overly technical or purely mathematical and algorithmic papers are out of scope of this mini-track.     Potential topics that this mini-track will address are (but not limited to): Theroretical and practical conceptualizations linking knowledge and judgement, big data/analytics and decisionmaking Knowledge innovation through emergent and convergent technologies (including big data and analytics)   Knowledge innovation and the use of big data and analytics for decision makers and entrepreneurs Knowledge fallibility and cognitive biases in using big data analytics Epistemic responsibility and its contribution to knowledge innovation Role of big data and analytics in leveraging intuition, judgment, and wisdom in organizations and society Socio-technical theories and application in the big data era Data-driven decision-making and the role of human input  Analysis of web and social media big data including text mining, sentiment analysis, and emotion analysis for decision making  Knowledge management, big data and analytics for formulating business strategy and government policy Design, development, and use of KM and analytics technologies to support data-driven decisions, judgments, and strategies Organizational barriers and enablers of the use of technology for KM and business analytics in managerial and strategic decision- and policy-making Data visualization as knowledge tool for decision-making Real time analysis of knowledge including wisdom of the crowds-based research Data-knowledge transformation for strategic decision-making Business analytics and big data challenges in managing data-driven operational, managerial, and strategic decision-making Data Mining of tacit and explicit knowledge  Organizational culture and data-driven organizations Issues concerning ethics, legality and security of data in judgment and decision making Individual, Intra-, and inter-organizational KM and business analytics technologies We intend to promote the mini-track via the individual network of each chair, the website of the MAD group, and the local academic events in New Zealand and Australia.   3) Discuss how these topics have recently been covered in other conferences and publications to substantiate that HICSS is an appropriate and timely forum for the topics.  Practitioners and researchers have long recognized the impact of technology on operational organizational processes: now these technologies have advanced to the point where they will be influencing higher levels of management including strategic decision making. Big data and analytics are such technologies. The chairs of this proposed track have written books and articles on the use of technology in management decision-making (Gressel, Pauleen, and Taskin, 2020; Intezari and Pauleen, 2019; Pauleen and Wang, 2017; Weerasinghe et al., 2018; Weerasinghe, 2019). Tracks similar to this one are now listed in most of the AIS-sponsored conferences, including:  ECIS 2016: Big Data, Business Analytics and Decision Support  ACIS 2019 - Knowledge Management and Analytics ECIS 2020: Business Analytics and Big Data AMCIS 2020: Data Science and Analytics for Decision Making  This proposed mini-track ran for the first time at HICCS 2021. It was reasonably successful for a first-time track. We had a very good online discussion with authors of accepted papers, who were very supportive of the track. Two of our authors won the best paper award for the Knowledge Innovation and Entrepreneurial Systems  track.  4) An explicit statement that your organization endorses your involvement and will pay for your travel and registration cost to attend HICSS. Please be aware of funding application deadlines. At least one minitrack chair is required to attend the conference.  Massey University supports HICSS, and has the means to support Prof Pauleen’s conference participation.

CHAN  QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY      ADRESSING DIVERSITY IN DIGITALIZATION  I. DESCRIPTION OF MINITRACK  The term diversity has raised much attention from scholars and practitioners alike to  discuss how  different  viewpoints,  mindsets,  educational backgrounds,  perspectives, and  knowledge (or the lack thereof) contribute to the ongoing digitalization in a variety of industries  (Olbrich et al., 2015; Sundermeier et al., 2020; E. M. Trauth, 2017). Despite the presence of  the topic in scholarly publications and public discourses, numerous examples indicate how  homogeneity,  instead  of  diversity  in  the  previously  outlined  dimensions,  leads  to  the  development of digital technologies that can be used to discriminate against certain groups  (Schmitt et al., 2020; E. Trauth et al., 2018; Urquhart & Underhill-Sem, 2009).   We only have a limited understanding of the relationship between digitalization – the  “phenomena and processes of adopting and using [digital] technologies in broader individual,  organizational, and societal contexts” (Legner et al., 2017) – and diversity, which can be  understood as the “the distribution of differences among the members of a unit” (Harrison &  Klein, 2007, p. 1200) with respect to demographic (e.g. age, gender, nationality, ethnicity),  functional (e.g. education, work experience, religion, income) and deep-level (e.g. diseases,  disabilities, traits, values, beliefs) attributes.  At least two explanations are available for relationship between digital technologies and  diversity (Sundermeier et al., 2021). Either these newly created technological structures reveal  a lack of diversity in the underlying social structures, or they help to create them. We have  learned how machine learning algorithms in recruiting discriminated against female applicants  (Paul, 2019) or facial recognition software fostered racial discrimination (Schmitt et al., 2020;  E. M. Trauth, 2017). Digital technologies start with representing our physical world with bits  and bytes (Yoo et al., 2012) and oftentimes, we find, they apply homogeneous categories in  the process. In the given examples, we first see that digital technologies are trained on data  reflecting male dominance in tech industries or existing recruiting patterns that support  homogeneous  workforces.  Second,  these  technologies  recreate  and  reinforce  already  dominant categories and homogeneous structures.  It is therefore worth asking whether digitalization can thereby be considered a ‘diversity- blind’ process. In order to promote greater awareness of diversity in this respect, it is important  to encourage the generation of theoretical knowledge that can help to explain how digital  technologies influence diversity (digital impact on diversity) and how digital technologies are  shaped by diversity or the lack thereof (diversity shaping digital technology). Eventually, this  understanding might help academics and practitioners alike in their efforts towards inclusive  design and application processes that avoid the pitfalls described earlier.  In this mini track, we invite scholars to advance our theoretical knowledge on the digital  impact on diversity, i.e. on inclusive design and application processes, practices and routines  of organizing data and information systems that consider the role of diversity, and the influence  ADRESSING DIVERSITY IN DIGITALIZATION  of diversity in shaping the role, usage, and design of digital technologies. We are open towards  diverse methodological and theoretical approaches and welcome contributions from scientists  and practitioners likewise.  Contributions to this mini track may include, but are not limited to:    ‘DIGITAL IMPACT ON DIVERSITY’ PERSPECTIVE    Understanding practices that address diversity issues in designing digital  artifacts    Theorizing challenges related to the consideration of different dimensions of  diversity in designing digital artifacts    Understanding implications of considering and neglecting societal diversity in  designing digital artifacts    ‘DIVERSITY SHAPING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY’ PERSPECTIVES    The role of individual identity and diversity in routines and practices  associated with the design and application of information systems and data    The role of individual identity and diversity in organizational capabilities  related to digitalization    Understanding outcomes of (less) inclusive design processes and organizing  practices (e.g. for marginalized or disadvantaged groups)    Highlighting the consequences of missing diversity reflections in design  processes for digital artifacts across levels of analysis (e.g. designer, venture,  society)    Development of theoretical frameworks that allow to holistically capture  impacts of (less) inclusive design practices for digital artifacts       ADRESSING DIVERSITY IN DIGITALIZATION  REFERENCES    Harrison, D.

Mature organisations often have established methods and systems in  use to capture and manage knowledge and innovation – which in turn supports process  improvement and product and/or service innovation. Start-ups and early-stage firms may  lack this capacity.       This mini track seeks studies of either early-stage firms/ start-ups or mature firms, or both  as comparisons, focussing on the innovation and entrepreneurship challenges associated  with different levels of firm maturity. These can be case studies, survey-based research,  models, maturity grids or other studies that examine how firm maturity, size or other  parameters are related to knowledge, innovation and entrepreneurship approaches.     Possible topics include, but are not limited to the following:    How do start-ups manage their knowledge and innovation?    In what ways does organisational culture enhance or impede innovation and  entrepreneurship approaches in start-ups and early-stage firms?    How does the degree of formality impact on innovation and entrepreneurship  approaches and effectiveness?    How do start-ups/early-stage firms manage tacit and explicit knowledge?    What theoretical frames are useful as lenses to examine approaches to innovation  and entrepreneurship in start-ups and early-stage firms?    How can entrepreneurs and start-ups compete with more maturely developed  firms?

The more innovative is an entrepreneurial opportunity, the less historical information is available to guide the entrepreneur and the more s/he relies on information obtained socially and experimentally.  However, the pressures of entrepreneurship during its different stages – innovation, business modelling, and growth – detracts innovators from knowledge management. The innovation stage calls for agility, tacit knowledge sharing, and at times knowledge concealment. Business modelling is often characterized by frequent pivoting and is less suited for knowledge capture, codification and transfer. Finally, the growth stage requires the entrepreneurial team to focus on processes, systems and codification so that the business becomes more efficient; explicit knowledge, rather than tacit knowledge, is key in this stage.  This mini-track welcomes research, cases and empirical evidence on the role of innovation and entrepreneurship as an end, as well as means to generate new knowledge and manage existing knowledge in either startup or corporate entrepreneurial domains. We are particularly interested in technical innovations that leverage IoT, deep learning and other technologies that capture and generate new knowledge. Theoretical and empirical papers on knowledge discovery are suitable to this track.  This mini-track also welcomes papers on the education and training of entrepreneurship students and practitioners in knowledge management.    Potential topics that the mini-track will address are:  Knowledge creation and innovation in entrepreneurship Examples of innovation and entrepreneurship in the field and in the classroom Knowledge management in entrepreneurship education Successes and failures: cases and lessons learned Tools and techniques for innovation in start-up and small enterprises Opportunity discovery and design thinking Innovation and open systems in support of entrepreneurship Knowledge management and ideation Social entrepreneurship theories, models and applications Corporate entrepreneurship theories and applications of knowledge management Digital entrepreneurship, digital products, services, tools and business models Knowledge creation and management in technological innovation Digital collaboration and knowledge exchanges in entrepreneurial networks Incubators and maker spaces as hubs for knowledge creation Automated and augmented data for innovation and knowledge discovery Virtualization of business processes and knowledge implications The role of universities in facilitating entrepreneurial growth Knowledge management and innovation in entrepreneurial ecosystems  Accepted papers will be invited to a special System Science Issue of the Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development.   Marketing plan, i.e., how do you plan to solicit papers:  Papers will be solicited through the academic and professional networks of the mini-track co-chairs. We have increased the number of co-chairs in order to expand such networks. In addition, listservs that we are connected to will be used to post the call, particularly INFORMS, IEEE, USASBE, ICSB and many others. Social media campaigns will also be part of the marketing outreach.  Bios:  Dr. Passerini joined Seton Hall on June 5, 2020 as Provost and Executive Vice President.

If your proposal is accepted, we will use this description on the HICSS  website.    This  minitrack  examines  the  nature  and  role  of  knowledge  flows  across  people,  organizations, places and times from technical, managerial, behavioral, organizational,  and  economic  perspectives.  As  the  nature  of  knowledge  flows  changes  due  to  digitalization,  consumerization  of  information  technology  (IT),  and  the  integration  of  artificial agents into daily routines, it is increasingly important to understand the changes  required in how knowledge workers conduct work, share knowledge and information, and  learn. Knowledge management (KM) activities in organizations are no longer supported  only by traditional information and communications technologies (ICTs; e.g., databases,  data  warehouses,  information  repositories,  websites,  email  streams),  but  are  also  enabled through new forms of ICTs including artificial intelligence (AI; e.g., agents, bots,  learning algorithms), social software or Web 2.0 technologies and Internet of Things (IoT).  The ubiquitous and pervasive nature of these new forms of ICTs are creating flexible KM  sharing environments that need to be researched more systematically.    b) Names and full mailing address, direct phone number, departmental phone  number and fax, email addresses for all minitrack chairs.

Minitrack title: “Knowledge Flows, Transfer, Sharing and Exchange.” This minitrack  focuses on examining the nature and role of knowledge flows (e.g., knowledge  exchange, transfer and sharing) across people, communities, networks and  organizations, as well as across both space and time. Technical, managerial,  behavioral, organizational and economic perspectives on knowledge flows will be  accepted and presented in this minitrack, and both qualitative and quantitative research  methods are welcome. Potential topics that this minitrack will address include:  o  Technical, managerial, behavioral, organizational and economic challenges and  perspectives on knowledge flows  o  The effects on knowledge flows of the consumerization of IT (CoIT); Internet of  things (IoT); social media, social computing, social networks and communities,  communities of practice (CoPs); information and computer technologies (ICTs);  knowledge reuse; organization and economic incentive structures; artificial  intelligence (AI), machine learning and robotics; neuroscience, brain-computer  interfaces, artificial humans and other computer-based entities  o  Knowledge system analysis, design, test, evaluation, implementation,  maintenance and redesign  o  Harnessing, analyzing, visualizing and measuring knowledge flows for creativity,  innovation, competitive advantage    Marketing will be accomplished via the Co-Chairs’ professional networks, which include  successful authors published via previous HICSS events, as well as promotion via list  servers and like venues. Based upon previous conferences, this approach is likely to  generate considerable interest.    3) Discuss how these topics have recently been covered in other conferences and  publications to substantiate that HICSS is an appropriate and timely forum for the  topics.    Most practitioners and researchers recognize that knowledge flows are extremely  important, especially in the current age where organizations have to continually learn  and innovate to remain competitive. Given that knowledge flow is seen as an essential  source of a firm’s sustainable competitive advantage, it is imperative to understand and  manage this process in an effective manner. This minitrack was first approved and  successfully implemented in HICSS 2003. We continue to have excellent attendance in  this minitrack, and the sessions continue to generate much thoughtful discussion. The  Editors (e.g., EICs, SEs, AEs) of prominent knowledge management and IS journals  (e.g., Information Systems Journal, Communications of the AIS, International Journal of  Knowledge Management, Knowledge Management Research & Practice) are looking in  part to this minitrack for papers that can be published in the journals.    4) An explicit statement that your organization endorses your involvement and  will pay for your travel and registration cost to attend HICSS. Please be aware of    3  funding application deadlines. At least one minitrack chair is required to attend  the conference.    All three of us attended the conference in 2020, and we all are expecting to attend in  2022.    4 "

Organizations  that  consider  themselves “learning” or “knowledge-based” organizations must develop a competent workforce  using organizational learning strategies. Success in organizations involves developing a variety of  human  factors  for  these  changing  competencies.  In  addition,  due  to  technological  change,  modification  and  revisions,  many  skills  require  updating  for  a  competitive  advantage  in  the  marketplace.   Innovation in learning organizations involves all the processes of creating, transferring, modifying,  and retaining knowledge over time. These updating processes may occur at the individual, group, or  organizational  levels.  This  minitrack  is  devoted  to  and  involves  topics  that  would  benefit  the  essential functions of organizations that use all types of knowledge. The focus will examine current  research on organizations and the knowledge workers within to understand the how to select, and  update current knowledge as well as behavioral strategies for learning and competency maintenance  and learning in order to gain a competitive advantage.  Proposed Research Area   Learning  Organizations  and  Knowledge  Organizations  need  to  focus  strategically  to  develop  organizational potential. There is a gap between current learning within organizations and their  ability  to  create,  acquire,  select,  transfer,  and  manage  knowledge  to  remain  competitive.  The  workers within these organizations also need to develop themselves through the selection and  acquisition of specialized skills for the work of the future. What they change and use as their current  knowledge  base  creates  current  competencies.  Effective  knowledge  management  strategies  are  needed to strengthen these organizations and will benefit from well-directed research in these  areas.   This mini track highlights examining the role of knowledge in organizations and individuals. How it  is decided to change, update, use, or disregard knowledge elements and how it is determined to  intentionally  suppress  existing  knowledge  is  of  interest.  This  mini-track  therefore,  expresses  diversity of organizational learning methods within a Knowledge Management framework. It seeks  to explore different ways in which organizational knowledge base is created, used, and modified.  The lens to view organizations may be diverse; organizations using socio-technical systems, where  the  term  knowledge  base  could  broadly  refer  to  individual  or  organizational  knowledge  (i.e.,  organizational and individual goals, norms, and processes) or refer to machine knowledge (i.e.,  information systems, data stores, and analytics) that can be applied or put into action.   Several factors that affect the success of knowledge base change within knowledge and learning  organizations  will  be  limited  to  research  in  the  following  areas:  organizational  cultural  considerations  in  knowledge  management,  trust  factors  and  human  social  interactions,  communication  strategies  to  promote  knowledge  acquisition  and  learning,  knowledge  transfer,  knowledge selection, updating processes, and change methods within organizations. In addition,  submissions dedicated to knowledge and learning organizations focused on leadership processes  will  be  accepted.  Interdisciplinary  contributions  connecting  related  research  streams  using  innovation, learning, unlearning, and intentional forgetting of knowledge (i.e., information systems  and psychology) are welcome within the IO minitrack. Fast track to journal publication is encouraged  and discovery will be available at the HICSS author meeting (for example, IJKM or others as indicated  by the subject matter presented).   Contributions from this minitrack of Organizational Learning may include, but are not limited the  following topics:     1.   Organizational learning:   1.1. Individual, group and organizational learning processes  1.2. Knowledge creation, acquisition, transfer, change and forgetting  1.3. Organizational memory and knowledge base  1.4.

There  are many questions that remain unanswered. What is the role of knowledge management in practice?  How do current theories regarding knowledge management and organizational learning contribute to  real-world applications? How can we facilitate best practices in knowledge use? While numerous  journals focus exclusively on these topics, and several information systems-oriented conferences  feature KM and OL-specific tracks, theory is at risk of being separated from functional practice and  administration.  Although not specifically  documented in the literature, there is a gap between  knowledge systems research currently being conducted with the operational, results-driven practical  experiences detailing needs of knowledge workers. We should be aware and allow a new focus on the  active practitioner of knowledge workers who develop, implement, manage, and use knowledge  management  systems.  Likewise,  there  are  countless  practical  perspectives  on  how  to  initiate,  coordinate, and monitor organizational learning processes that need to be explored and recorded.      The goal of this minitrack is to provide this “bridge” between the academic and theoretical knowledge  management; the learning scholars that develop theory and the systems practitioner community that  actually uses this knowledge on a daily basis. Fast track to journal publication is encouraged and  discovery will be available at the HICSS author meeting (for example, IJKM or others as indicated by  the subject matter presented).       This mini-track encourages two directions of knowledge exchange. On the one hand, it addresses the  question of how theory informs and impacts practice. On the other hand, it sheds light on how  practice can influence theory. Methods can include – but are not limited to- case study and action  research.     Possible contributions regarding reports from the field in knowledge management may include, but  are not limited to the following:     1.  Best practices in using technology, processes, or personnel to promote:  1.1. Knowledge creation  1.2. Knowledge maintenance  1.3. Storage of knowledge  1.4. Retrieving knowledge  1.5. A willingness to contribute to a knowledge repository  1.6. A willingness to seek knowledge from a knowledge repository  1.7. Learning and unlearning processes in organizations  1.8. Communities of Practice    2.  Specific challenges encountered in knowledge management that either:   2.1. Have been successfully been overcome in designing, implementing or using a knowledge  management system  2.2.  Those challenges that have defied resolution    3.  Knowledge Management and strategic planning:  3.1. Strategic planning of knowledge management processes  3.2. Vision development and KM; theoretical and practical foundations of knowledge-based  vision and strategy development  3.3. KM, strategy and organizational routines    4.  Other challenges to the research community      All types of papers are welcomed and we consider this minitrack focusing on a variety of issues  including the “softer side” of Knowledge Management (KM). This perspective is not often addressed,  but can make substantial contributions of great interest to the practioner and the scholar alike.  Drawing from diverse and interdisciplinary fields are appropriate for focused studies in this minitrack,  and are not limited to, an application of current theory, the perspective and application of the  practitioner or the KM scholar. We invite both industry and the research community to participate in  this minitrack. Traditional scholarly requirements are modified and all methodologies meeting the  criteria and will be considered.     The Co-Chairs are both committed to scholarly endeavors of both industry and faculty.

Therefore, a high maturity level of KM research has been achieved. However, organizational knowledge/KM initiatives are more and more faced with budget cuts and justification demands due to intense competition in today’s business environments. The influences of the rapid pace of globalization and of the ongoing liberalization of national and international markets lead to the emergence of increased pressure on existing companies. Project managers of knowledge/KM initiatives like Chief Knowledge Officers need to justify their budgets and, thus, are in need of qualitative and quantitative evidence of the initiatives’ success. In addition, ROI calculations and traditional accounting approaches do not tell an adequate story when proposing knowledge-based initiatives. This minitrack explores research into strategies, methodologies, and stories that relate to measuring this success. In addition, this minitrack will be used to explore the bodies of performance measurements that define the current state of research in measuring knowledge system, KM, organizational memory, and organizational learning success. Eventually, another purpose of this minitrack is to present research on how to value knowledge-based initiatives.  Possible Paper Topics: Frameworks and models for assessing knowledge systems, knowledge management, and/or organizational memory systems Methodologies and processes for measuring knowledge systems, knowledge management and/or organizational memory success and performance Impact of knowledge use, knowledge management strategy, organization, systems, culture, and other issues on knowledge management/organizational memory success Organizational effectiveness/efficiency due to knowledge management/organizational memory/organizational learning, knowledge and organizational memory use Knowledge systems, knowledge management, organizational memory, and organizational learning metrics Knowledge systems, knowledge management, organizational memory, and organizational learning success factors and key performance indicators Benchmarking of knowledge systems/knowledge management/organizational memory initiatives Case studies of knowledge systems, knowledge management and organizational memory success and performance measurements Measuring knowledge systems, knowledge management and/or organizational memory performance in global organizations and globally dispersed communities Effectiveness and/or efficiency of knowledge systems/knowledge management/organizational memory systems and/or innovation, entrepreneurship and crowd systems Modeling and measuring the impact of social software on knowledge system/knowledge management performance Measuring the effects and value of AI and AR implementations in/for organizations Measuring the role and impact of diversity in knowledge systems/knowledge management/organizational memory systems Defining knowledge systems, knowledge management and organizational memory success Rigorous anecdotes and user stories and their theoretical basis to facilitate the value of knowledge-based initiatives Developing grounded theory approaches to valuing knowledge-based initiatives Understanding knowledge-based initiatives’ activities and output as service offerings and exploring their productivity Usage, adoption and success of knowledge management methods  Coverage in other Conferences: Knowledge management is a very popular IS research topic, and has received attention at most academic conferences in Information Systems. However, this minitrack is unique in the sense that it strives to investigate value, performance and success measurements of knowledge systems, knowledge management, organizational memory, and respective systems. Additionally, the 27-years history of the original KM/OM Implementation and other Issues minitrack at HICSS makes it one of the oldest and most established outlets for scholars and academics working in these areas.  3. Continuation of a current research area: This minitrack represents a continuation of the topics addressed in knowledge systems, knowledge management, organizational memory, and organizational learning in past HICSS conferences. The popularity of this topic has been proved by the high number of paper submissions, high quality presentations, high attendance numbers, and sustained interest in the area. We expect the minitrack will continue the evolution of knowledge systems, knowledge management, organizational memory, and organizational learning discipline.

Digital transformation is leading to application of locational data for  organizational intelligence and decision making in the areas of business operations, marketing,  management information systems, supply chain management and logistics, environment, natural  resources, healthcare, retail, sharing economy, public safety, risk mitigation and disaster  management, among others. Scholarly research papers are sought that apply a variety of theories  and empirical techniques, quantitative, and qualitative, to understand how location, geography,  and related data are increasingly important to incorporate into the system sciences. There is a  need to develop new theories and modify existing ones for the systems sciences that incorporate  spatial data, locational intelligence, and geographical concepts. Current concepts of data science,  big data, trust, and privacy need attention in addressing locational intelligence research  questions.  Research papers will be solicited across a range of topics, including but not limited to:    •  Spatial Business: Analyses that address a range of business functions, including marketing,  customer relations, operations, logistics, supply chain, asset and risk management  •  Spatial Health and Healthcare: Analyses that address locational dimensions of health and  delivery of healthcare.  •  Sustainability and Climate Change: Analyses that explore the spatial dimensions of  environmental sustainability and climate change.  •  Industry Clusters and Community Development: Analyses that address spatial aspects of  economic development and community impacts, including infrastructure, workforce,  environmental impacts, and social inequalities.  •  Emergency Management and Public Safety: Studies of systems for locational intelligence and  decision-making in crises and emergencies.  •  Location Analytics for Spatial Big Data: Analyses that introduce and enhance such emerging  areas of space-time modeling, spatial analytics, locational decision-making, geography of the  sharing economy, and spatially referenced social media.  •  Spatial Theory, Concepts and Methods: Analyses that explore innovative approaches to  advancing spatial theory, concepts, and methods.  •  Locational Data Privacy and Security: Research on the issues and problems of locational data  privacy and security.      Minitrack Proposal  Location Intelligence Research in System Sciences   1 of 3  Marketing plan    For HICSS-54 (2021), the inaugural minitrack on Location Intelligence research (under the  invited Track, Location Intelligence) was marketed extensively across academic networks such  as the Association for Information Systems (AIS), INFORMS, American Association of  Geographers (AAG), and ACM. Specifically, members of Special Interest Groups such as SIG- Geographic Information System (SIGGIS) and SIG-Decision Support and Analytics (SIGDSA)  of AIS, SIGSpatial of ACM, the Business Geography Specialty Group of AAG were targeted. A  comprehensive Call for Papers was also circulated in the HigherEd listserv of Esri, the largest  location intelligence company worldwide. This marketing strategy drew significant interest in the  inaugural Location Intelligence Research minitrack from academics and industry professionals in  diverse areas such as transportation planning and management, geospatial big data analytics,  geo-blockchain, location privacy, and economic development.    The minitrack co-authors will follow a similar marketing plan for this HICSS-55 minitrack. In  addition, minitrack co-chairs will also reach out to their own network of research contacts in  areas such as geographic information systems (GIS), Geography, GIScience, Computer Science,  etc. The minitrack will be also be marketed to healthcare related SIGs (for example, Health  Applications Society at INFORMS, and SIG-Health of AIS) this year, in light of the proliferating  use of human mobility data and location-based analytics by researchers in many areas to model,  analyze, and forecast spatial patterns and diffusion of COVID-19. The minitrack’s Call for  Papers will be circulated via listservs of the aforementioned SIGs and Specialty Groups on a  biweekly basis. The co-chairs also plan to market the minitrack via their own LinkedIn networks.   Name, affiliation, and contact information of minitrack co-chair(s)     Dr. James B.

Examples  can  be  found  across  areas  such  as  management  decision  making,  manufacturing, and even design and creative applications (e.g., Ambach and Repenning 1996;  Kittur et al. 2019). These tools use data science techniques to generate predictive insights, some  of which can be described as rational agents that perform tasks in an autonomous fashion, i.e.,  with little or no user intervention. AI methods are guided by their underlying machine learning  models and associated functions. They constitute a new type of material agency in the context  of contemporary organizing.     But as organizations become more reliant on AI methods, they need new management theories,  frameworks, and methodologies that can help them understand the consequences of using these  AI tools—both at the level of structures and organizational practices. Such agents often rely on  complex internal processing, their behavior is less predictable than that of the types of IT  artifacts we are used to dealing with (Xiao and Benbasat 2007). This opens up a number of  problem areas with regards to managing and organizing these methods (Puranam et al. 2014).  For example:   •  How does coordination shift as AI tools are used, and what new types of organizational  hierarchies and structures emerge?   •  How do power relations change, and how do different organizational actors use these  new technologies to reshape power relations?   •  What is the impact of using AI on those processes that have traditionally been seen as  being entirely driven and controlled by humans?  •  How can the organization evaluate the ethical implications of deployed AI methods?  •  What are relevant KPIs and metrics for assessing the effectiveness of AI applications?  •  How should an organization manage, staff and coordinate AI development teams?    This mini-track aims to contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms through which  humans organize together with AI-based systems as well as the process organizations use to  develop these AI methods and systems.    We aim to provide a platform for thought and discussion in this important and emergent field  within  information  systems  and  IT  research.  We  invite  conceptual  as  well  as  empirical  contributions using different methodological approaches (qualitative, quantitative, design- oriented, simulation, etc.).    In addition to the questions raised above, potential topics include, but are not limited to:   •  AI & coordination: How does AI change the way humans coordinate?  •  AI & power: How does AI affect corporations, markets, and peer production structures?  •  AI & governance: Who runs the technology? What does the technology run?  •  AI & development: How to manage project and deployment risk?  •  AI & creativity: How can AI be creative? How can humans and AI be co-creators?  •  AI & design: What does AI design? Should it design itself?  •  AI & innovation: How does AI foster innovation?  •  AI & crowds: What do crowds do for machine learning, and what’s in it for the crowds?  •  AI & organizational routines: How does AI change the nature of work?

As a result of rapid digital transformation, organizations are facing various challenges, covering the whole life cycle of BI/BA/big data applications and projects. Moreover, in the age of the pandemic, analytics driven data democratization and analytics-enabled digital resilience are shifting traditional data governance practices and the data driven culture in organizations. At the same time, companies are experiencing an unprecedented shortage in skills and analytical capabilities, which in turn limit their potential.  In addition, the growth in this space has led to societal implications, both positive and negative, that are felt strongly by more organizations, communities and societies in yet-to-be understood ways. The ongoing evolution of this field has created a state of flux, with new opportunities and challenges constantly emerging.   To close the gap between potential and real benefits of BI/BA/big data, more research on their deployment is needed in terms of artifacts such as methods, reference architectures, etc. as well as theoretical and conceptual underpinnings. Finally, operations and continuous enhancement of BI/BA/big data applications encompass management tasks that consider strategic, economic, legal, societal, ethical, and more recently, human rights issues.  Starting from a rich historic advancement in decision support systems, to more recently big data, IoT, machine learning, algorithmic decision-making, cognitive analytics and AI, this space continues to present a wide variety of research questions and challenges for researchers to explore.  This minitrack will accept papers focused on the business, organizational and societal aspects of business intelligence, business analytics and big data as well as challenges related to BI/BA/big data workforce including their education and ongoing professional development.

Blockchain, the technology underlying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, has been receiving considerable  attention in recent years, as new use cases in the public and private sector have been identified. What  started as a solution to the double spend problem with digital money, is being explored as the backbone  technology in scenarios where a trusted third party (e.g., a notary or a bank) is normally required. Using  this technology, transactions are securely registered on a data structure (aka the ledger) distributed  across a network of peers that validate the entries using a consensus mechanism. New records are  cryptographically linked to existing ones, rendering them virtually immutable. The resulting auditability  and transparency have been leveraged in proposing innovative solutions to land registries, to stop the  spread of conflict diamonds, to fight the counterfeiting of medication, to make supply chains less  opaque, and, generally, to promote new financial services.    Additionally, blockchains can also store and enforce the execution of algorithmic code know as smart  contracts – pieces of code that are executed automatically once predetermined conditions are met –  further reducing uncertainty and promoting confidence among stakeholders that would not normally  trust each other. Nevertheless, we are still in the early days of blockchain adoption, compared by some  to the introduction of the World Wide Web itself. Then, as now, few if any could predict the full extent  of the disruptive innovations that would emerge fostered by this emerging technology.    For these reasons, it is important for academics to systematically research this field, at various levels.  Conferences play a key role in disseminating knowledge about Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT -  including blockchains) due to the speed at which developments occur.

Yet, recent studies and observations have revealed worrying evidence that IT use may also be hiding potentially serious “dark sides”  []. In other words, IT use may lead to a host of negative consequences with varying degrees of severity for individuals, employees, families, firms and societies []. For example, studies have shown that people spend approximately one fourth of their workday handling IT-related interruptions. To exacerbate the matter, it can take almost twenty minutes to get back to the original task after the interruption is over. This can translate into a significant psychological burden for employees and tremendous financial burden for the organization. Furthermore, employees’ misuse of organizational IT could account for 50-75 percent of all information security breaches []. Additional findings indicate that 43 percent of users find the use of smartphones stressful; 60 percent of users cannot go for an hour without checking their phones for messages and email; 24 percent of users check their smart phones while driving; and 54 percent check their smart phones in the middle of the night or immediately upon waking up [].  Moreover, 28 percent of employees admitted to playing while at work []. This is perhaps not surprising given that 0.7-11% of the Internet user population can be classified as addicts to an Internet application [], and many others present addiction-like symptoms that do not meet addiction classification criteria [, ]. Consequently, employees often engage in unplanned technology-mediated behaviors such as swearing [, ], and organizational deviance []. Such technology-mediated behavior patterns can heavily harm individuals, firms and societies []. Adding to this array of issues, concerns about artificial intelligence [] and fake news emerged in recent years [].Concerns about social responsibility of technology giant  [] as well as possible negative effects of technologies on children [] and youth [] have also surfaced.  Emerging results around the duality in the consequences of IT use, without doubt, extend beyond the discussed examples and academic research is beginning to unravel and reveal potential dark sides of IT use. Given the ubiquitous and obligatory nature of IT use in organizations, the prevalence of use among at-risk populations such as children, and these early findings, it is imperative that the IS research community take upon itself the rigorous examination of possible “dark sides” of IT use. The “Dark Side of IT” track welcomes theoretical and empirical papers examining alternative consequences of IT use and implementation in organizations and societies. The objective of this minitrack is to focus not only on the antecedents, development processes, and consequence of numerous phenomena related to the unexpected negative effects of IT use, but also on potential strategies and techniques for behavioral interventions. We seek, based on this forum of discussion, to provide practitioners (e.g., IT developers, managers, psychologists, and policy makers) in a multitude of contexts with a deeper understanding of the potential consequences regarding the dark sides of IT use. Further, we hope these studies help to shape guidelines for designing and implementing organizational and hedonic IT while minimizing the potential negative consequences of IT use. Submitted papers might focus on, but are not limited to, some of the following themes related to potential dark sides of IT use. We acknowledge that over time new dark side of IT phenomena will emerge, and we hence call welcome topics that focus on IT-related phenomena which is harmful, that may extend this list. Problematic IS use behaviors IT-related addictions, misuse and abuse Cyber loafing Cyber bullying  Dark sides of artificial intelligence and/or robots Dark sides of big data Dark sides of digital assistants and wearable devices Deceptive computer-mediated communication  Fake news Disrupted work-life balance IT interruptions  Technostress Impulsive use of IT Adverse physiological effects of IT use  Submissions are welcome and encouraged from a variety of theoretical foundations (e.g., information systems, psychology, cognitive science, decision sciences, sociology, social networks, organizational behavior, neuroscience, computer science, and informatics) which might advance our knowledge of the antecedents, processes, interventions and consequences of the dark side of IT use. The track invites relevant and rigorous studies without restriction for the methodologies used, units of analyses and levels of theorization.

Data analytics (DA) could transform the real value that firms generate in the near future because  patterns discovered from past archives enable firms to identify opportunities and risks and better  plan for the future. In addition to producing more value externally, DA also affects internal process,  improving productivity, utilization, and growth. Thus, acknowledged potential benefits of DA  technology include reduced risks and costs, improved system quality and transparency, the ability  to focus on core competencies, and access to new technologies.    However, firms that invest highly in complex or asset-specific DA are likely to create transaction  difficulties and generate agency problems that could lead to cost overruns and, ultimately, project  failure. Therefore, not all firms investing in DA improve their businesses because of different  strategic choices, significant risks and uncertainties in governance, economy, and environment.     In this mini-track, we seek research papers and experience reports that explore the role that DA  play in identifying and analyzing a firm’s strategic determinants and establishing effective control  environments. Analyzing data in a timely manner enables firms to gain insights into their internal  and external environments and to better sense changes in their markets; indeed, it serves as a basis  for determining how risks, control effectiveness, and policy compliance should be managed. With  data surrounding us, how businesses can take advantage of the insights generated by DA to better  understand risks and uncertainties that they are facing and more importantly, to improve their  business strategy and control systems are important questions. Further, we seek to focus on some  key determinants of DA and control systems, including the metrics for DA strategic techniques  and success, how the use of DA in start-ups can be leveraged in other contexts, and in general,  expanding the use of DA beyond organizational systems.     Possible topics for the mini-track include but are not limited to:   - Data Analytics and Business Strategy   - Data Analytics and Reporting   - Using Data Analytics to Manage Business Risks   - Data Analytics and Performance Evaluation such as KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)   - The Impact of Different Data Analytics Application Types (e.g., descriptive, diagnostic,  predictive and prescriptive analytics)  - Effects of Automation on Business Outcomes and Efficiency   - Current Practices of Data Analytics in Internal Control   - Data Analytics and Continuous Monitoring and Control Activities   - Using Data Analytics to Detect and Prevent Fraud   - The Use of Artificial Intelligence in Risk Management   - The Use of Machine Learning to Enhance Predictive Modeling     Marketing Plan:     Continue a practice of marketing HICSS as a place where “systems thinkers” get  together, from a variety of fields. Attendees and speakers will benefit from exposure to  more fields (and markets for their research).       Market this session and venue as mutual respected conferences/workshops, such as  Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS), Decision Sciences Institute,  International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS), and Association for Information  Systems Special Interest Group on Accounting Information Systems (SIG ASYS), where  both accounting and information system academics and professionals can meet, discuss  and collaborate.       Solicit key influencers in data analytics practices. This will combine mailing lists from  Dr. Jee-Hae Lim, who is active in the Accounting Information Systems (AIS) academic  and professional communities, and Dr. Tu Xu, who is active in the Data Analytics  academic and training communities.       As an Editor of Journal of Information Systems (JIS), and an associated editor of  International Journal of Accounting Information Systems (IJAIS), Dr. Jee-Hae Lim will  encourage researchers to submit papers, which can be selectively considered for  publication in either JIS and IJAIS at the authors’ prerogative.

However, the rise of digitalization has led  scholars to increasingly question the explanatory power and usefulness of existing technology  adoption and related organizational research. The aim of this minitrack is to focus on how we  can design organizations at multiple levels spanning jobs, units, business processes, and  organizational design to develop appropriate digital and managerial capabilities and set up the  work context to fully leverage the functionality of technologies to support the digitization  process. As current digital infrastructures become more complex and technologies spill over  into the workforce, the Designing for Digital minitrack welcomes theoretical and empirical  contributions that explore the responsiveness of digital and IT infrastructures, how they interact  with the design of organizations, units, and workplaces, and, in a top-down approach, how  managers  can  design  workplaces  and  work  processes  to  address  digital  encroachment.  Furthermore, in a bottom-up perspective, we are interested in how individuals can adjust their  mindset from digital resistance to digital encroachment as they confront digitized work changes  within the appropriate design framework. We hope that these studies will help to develop  guidelines for the design and implementation of solutions that address how digitalization can  be harnessed for sustainable growth of individuals and organizations while minimizing its  potentially harmful consequences.  Submitted papers should focus on, but are not limited to, some of the following topics related  to the creation, implementation, and adaptation of IT systems in interaction with the design of  organizations, units, workplaces, and business processes:    A multi-level approach to organizational design spanning job, unit, business process  and organizational design;    The responsiveness of digital and IT infrastructures;     Design of algorithmic accountability systems in organizations;    Digital capabilities and IT tools development in order to leverage technology  functionality in supporting digitalization;     Digitizing work changes, job characteristics and bottom-up job design initiatives (e.g.,  job crafting);    Characteristics, context, dynamics and the future of digital remote work;     Individuals’ mindsets, digital resistance and digital encroachment and their interaction  with design elements at various levels;    Design of digital platforms and collective systems of engagement;     Designing digitally-mediated, virtual and crowd-work;  Submissions from a variety of theoretical foundations (e.g., information systems, psychology,  cognitive science, decision sciences, sociology, social networks, organizational behavior, and  computer  science)  that  could  advance  our  knowledge  of  the  antecedents,  processes,  interventions, and consequences associated with shaping businesses and organizations in the  digital economy are welcome and encouraged.

DSR is a prominent form of engaged scholarship, which combines inquiry with a potential for action and intervention.  DSR may be viewed as having three related subfields, from which we welcome submissions:  Science of design, which focuses on creating ‘new-to-the-world’ artifacts . We try to provide an outlet for researchers doing novel artifact driven research in information systems, but also in other fields such as industrial engineering or service design.  Design theory studies, which focus on the development of theories and design principles concerned with creating new or improved systems based on kernel or grand theories [4-6].  Design Research, which focuses on the study of how designers actually conduct design activities, e.g., science of design research. Papers in this subfield could potentially come not only from IS, but also from architecture and design studies.    All three subfields are often (but not always) tightly engaged with design practice.  Accordingly, they frequently embody participative forms of research that rest on the advice and perspectives of multiple stakeholders in understanding a complex social problem.  While specific interest is placed upon DSR and design theorizing with respect to the three subfields described above, the minitrack welcomes submissions from the entire range of alternatives that deal with the question of integrating inquiry with the potential of creating and shaping alternative futures.  Such work extends the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by theorizing and/or creating new and innovative artifacts. The building and application of these designed artifacts produces knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solutions, which is then potentially transferable to other domains. In design science, the engagement is primarily focused on the design and evaluation of an artifact; learning through building with the aim to generate theoretical insights. This is often an iterative research process and sometimes capitalizes on learning via both researcher and subject expertise within the context of the participants' social system. It can be a clinical method that puts IS researchers in an active supporting role for advanced practice. To this end we also seek implementable and grounded action frames for engaging in such generalizable inquiries.  Accordingly, the scope of this mini track includes research contributions that arise from all three subfields of DSR described above.  This includes engaged approaches, studies of the practical use of DSR approaches, the use of such approaches to expand theory, and conceptual foundations that significantly and cogently expand our understanding of the epistemology and methodology of such approaches and their philosophical underpinnings.  These include:  Developing design artifacts and design theories Evaluating and testing design artifacts and design theories Different approaches to the design of artifacts and design theorizing Design as a creative act in development for systems etc. Advancing theory and practice in designing for systems etc. Design experiences in organizational systems and technology etc. Concrete design projects and their outcomes  Bios:   Richard Baskerville is a Regents’ Professor at Georgia State University.

This innovation involves generation of digital products and services (digital innovation), and the consequent fundamental changes to organizations, organizational networks and industries (digital transformation). These innovations are often created and realized through new ventures either in startups or existing organizations (digital entrepreneurship).  The goal of this minitrack ‘Digital Innovation, Transformation, & Entrepreneurship’ is to examine the nexus between digital technologies, consequent innovation and entrepreneurial action by offering a venue for original and innovative research that focuses on digital technologies, associated innovation, and related entrepreneurial activities and forms.  The minitrack solicits three types of submissions: (1) the antecedents, processes, infrastructures, outcomes, and organizational settings associated with the generation and appropriation of novel product and service innovations enabled by digital technologies; (2) new organizing structures and processes enabled by digitalization, as well as associated novel organizational arrangements and business models, the transformation process, antecedents, and outcomes; and (3) new ventures that involve the identification and deployment of emerging, radical innovations in digital technologies such as block-chain, 5G or IoT. Next we will describe each of these types of submissions with examples of each.  (1) Digital Innovation These submissions investigate the role and functions of digital technologies within innovative products or services, and how these technologies impact consequent organizational innovation and strategy (e.g., questions of architecture, modularity, platform governance, standards and means of systems integration). Topics can include: Organizing for digitally-enabled products and services Products and services developed around novel and emerging digital technologies Digital technologies and service science Digital convergence and organizational and industrial organization Digitalization of physical products and changes in product strategies Design thinking for digital Innovating within digital service ecosystems and on platforms Digital product architectures Digitalization, product modularity, and modes of organizing Digital controls and control points and organizing Digital twin and related product capabilities Products and services enabled by emerging generic digital technologies (e.g., robots, 3D printing, sensor networks, blockchain, quantum computing, etc.) and novel digital phenomena such as mobility, social, big data, cloud computing, service architectures, virtual/augmented reality, Internet of Things. (2) Digital Transformation As organizations transition from the industrial to the digital age, they need to undergo a transformation in how they organize and control for new digital processes.

New ventures and established organizations alike are concerned with generating radical business models and solutions that leverage digital technologies. Topics exploring digital innovation and entrepreneurship, broadly conceived are welcomed including: New venturing with and by digital technologies and digital business models Entrepreneurship forms and models within organizations enabled by digital technologies Entrepreneurial launch processes with digital technologies such as agile and lean startup Structuring of organizations to generate and enable new ventures (structural, contextual ambidexterity) Incubators, accelerators, and ecological processes to launch and sustain digital ventures Finance of digital technology entrepreneurship including corporate funding, venture capital, private equity, angel investing, etc. Digital tools enabling creativity, design, engineering, and other innovative entrepreneurial activities. Infrastructures for organizational and interorganizational innovation, such as product lifecycle management (PLM) systems in manufacturing; information modeling (BIM) environments in the AEC industry; or cyberinfrastructure (or e-science) in science. Infrastructures and ecosystems of emerging generic digital technologies (e.g., robots, 3D printing, sensor networks, blockchain, etc.) and digital phenomena such as mobile, social, big data, cloud computing, Internet of Things and related entrepreneurial forms  The types of studies that we welcome in the minitrack include an explicit focus on a particular form or function of digital technology in the context of organizational innovation, transformation, and entrepreneurship. Beyond this requirement, we welcome all forms of research inquiry, including qualitative, quantitative, mixed, and conceptual papers. In particular, we prefer novel applications of: Quantitative and computationally-intensive studies including mixed methods Case studies and detailed interpretive work Design science and action research in organizational settings Ambitious, provocative, and creative conceptual or theoretical analyses of the nature and effects of digitalization    A NOTE TO TRACK CHAIRS:   Why is this minitrack appropriate for the Organizational Systems and Technology Track?  This mini-track is appropriate for the “Organizational Systems and Technology” track because we emphasize organizational innovations that are made possible by digital technologies. Continuous digital innovation is incessantly creating new processes, products/service, and infrastructures possible for organizations – this track explicitly addresses this novel interaction of organizational aspects of digital innovation.    Why is this minitrack different from related minitracks at HICSS?   Although, in a sense, all of the minitracks of the “Organizational Systems and Technology” track have to do with digital innovations and organizing, there is no explicit place for scholars who emphasize the unique forms of broad analyses of organizational innovation that founded on evolving digital capabilities. As a result of this continued accumulative evolution organizations now deal with new modes of organizing, different ways to create and deliver goods and services, and face deep changes in their industries – generally we are experiencing a huge variety of original innovations that digital technologies now enable. This minitrack offers an intellectual home for a large and growing community of organizational, innovation and IS scholars who attend explicitly to the aspect of digital innovation.   Outside of this track, there are a several minitracks that are similar in talking about digital innovation, but none expressly addresses the new organizational and entrepreneurial element. In the “Internet and the Digital Economy” track, for example, the focus of the minitracks are on markets, society, and broader movements – nothing explicitly about organizations and new innovative forms of organizing. Similarly, the “Digital Media: Content & Communication” track attends to specific work practices and interactions with digital media, but there is no call for anything involving explicitly organizational research and new forms of organizational innovation enabled by digital technologies. In the past this minitrack has also been successful in soliciting a significant number of high quality manuscript across the globe, it has been well attended, and the participation has triggered broad and substantive discussions of the antecedents, forms and outcomes of digital innovation and related phenomena."

The submissions can be research  papers, case studies, or practitioner reports. The first two editions drew good audiences  and we had good sessions on both. We believe that we can grow this to two session MT as  the topic remains important.      Evolving digital platforms, or infrastructures, (such as the smart grid, Google services,  cloud platforms, Amazon, Facebook, e-health, Internet of Things platforms, etc.) are  deeply intertwined to the everyday life of businesses and citizens. We claim that in the  future the success of businesses and public sector organizations is dependent on their  ability to harness both new technology and its social capacities. These digital capabilities  are afforded by the platforms. The platforms are often global, remote, and nearly invisible,  and thus they cannot be controlled by people utilizing them. In addition, digital platforms  and  infrastructures may  change or  evolve,  and include unknown security risks and  strategic threats. Managing these changes, risks and opportunities is challenging for any  local developer, or user, of different kinds of digital products and services. At the same  time readily available global platforms (e.g. Amazon AWS, Google apps, Facebook APIs  to  name  a  few)  offer  enormous  power  for  even  the  smallest  developer  and  user  organizations. The objective of this minitrack is to understand and demonstrate how these  local actors can benefit from the strategic use of existing and coming digital platforms and  infrastructures.    This minitrack proposal focuses on actors that do not own or are not able to establish their  own infrastructures or platforms. They are often referred to as non-focal actors (Selander  et al. 2013). A non-focal actor is at the periphery of a digital platform (Ibid.). The platform  is not dependent on a single non-focal actor and, in principle, a non-focal actor may  choose to which platforms it connects. However, to survive and succeed in their business,  non-focal actors need to integrate to platforms owned and managed by others. Often there  are no alternatives, as global platforms have a tendency to form monopolies because of  the winner-takes-it-all economics (Eisenmann et al. 2006), such as is the case with  Amazon, Google and Facebook.    Most businesses are non-focal from the viewpoint of digital platforms. Most platforms  constitute of webs of services that connect together, and are developed by the networks  of service providers. All this causes several changes to conventional practices and  perspectives, for example to the principles of IT development and management, and to  the role of IT in business. Development processes will become continuous because  infrastructures and business requirements are in constant flux. The infrastructures cannot  be controlled by non-focal actors but they often belong to global internet or e-commerce  giants. From the non-focal perspective, the process of development and integration is  changed into a reactive mode where most development is done against the changes in  the capabilities of the infrastructure, or to provide a match between the infrastructure and  the business need (Henfridsson & Bygstad 2013).    This far platforms have been mostly studied from purely technical, societal or business  viewpoints. There is very little research that concentrates on the interplay between these  areas,  especially  from  the  service,  systems,  software  construction,  or  management  viewpoints. This calls for studies that combine software engineering, information systems  and business management to understand the creation of novel solutions for non-focal  actors that must be able to identify the risks and opportunities related to digital platforms  and infrastructures and prepare for technology and business changes in the future. We  also plan a special issue of a journal on the topic in the future if there is enough interest in  it.    This mostly neglected research area will be increasingly important for research and  practice when the use of digital platforms increases and different consequences due to  inappropriate integration, and wrong platform choices, emerge. So far research and  development efforts have been mostly concentrated in building new platforms. There is  no clear advice or instructions for practitioners available on how smaller players could  optimally benefit from existing digital platforms and infrastructures.     We seek for studies employing exploratory and confirmatory research approaches, as well  as novel designs.  References  Eisenmann, Thomas, Parker, Geoffrey, & Van Alstyne, Marshall W. (2006).

Schmidt1  Dr. Ronald Freeze2   and   Dr. Sathya Narasimhan.3    1 Washburn University, USA  2 University of Arkansas, USA  3 SAP, Inc.    Overview of Technical Area:    Title of Mini-Track:    Enterprise Ecosystem: Extending and Integrating Technology Serving the Enterprise     Research Track:    Organizational Systems and Technology    Journals for fast track opportunities:  Have established a Fast Track journal relationship with the International Journal of Accounting  Information Systems (IJAIS). We continue actively seeking an additional Fast Track journal  partner (seeking Enterprise journal or European Journal of Information Systems EJIS).    Partnership with Business Industry Partner:  This year this track welcomes participation of  the leading international ERP firm of SAP with the addition of co-chair, Dr. Sathya Narasimhan,  Sr. Director, New Ventures and Technologies at SAP, Inc.    Mini-Track Description:     The Enterprise Ecosystem has the integrated enterprise system as the foundation, such  corporate systems must continuously evolve and expand to serve the changing needs of the  corporate strategy and the business environment. Expanding the enterprise ecosystem is required  when  adopting  emerging  technologies  and  responding  to  changing  business  requirements.  Management of the enterprise system is being expanded, altered and complicated by digital  transformation and continual addition of new innovations. Many firms are migrating to cloud  computing or absorbing emergent technologies such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence,  supply chain automation, IoT and Blockchain. For sustainability of the organization, there is a  need to leverage ‘Big Data”. As data achieves higher volume, velocity, and variety, firms seek  value by harvesting insights from advanced data analytics. To fully leverage an innovation, it must  be integrated into business processes and operations supported within the Enterprise Ecosystem.   The challenge to integrate technological innovations and adapt business processes within  organizational systems continues. ERPs are continually enhanced with technology innovations. In  addition, organizations are continually investing time to link their ERP systems with supply-chain  1    partner  systems  in  efforts  to  streamline  and  automate  the  entire  supply-chain.  Such  inter- organizational systems typify a newer challenge of process integration across corporate and  international  boundaries.  Normative  literature  shows  that  intra-organizational  integration  is  achieved  in  cases  where  ERP  systems  are  leveraged.  However, the  integration  of  business  processes and systems between companies is complicated and difficult. This issue is more complex  when seeking extensive automation of inter-organizational business processes, or after a merger  or acquisition.  The challenge for organizations include both internal and external integration  challenges, but also must explore the establishment of new IT infrastructure business models.  These emerging IT infrastructure innovations that impact integrated enterprise systems include:  Hyperautomation (combining topics such as Robotic Process Automation (RPA), process mining  and user behavior mining, combined with Natural Language Processing (NLP)), telemetry devices,  cloud computing, IoT, visual interfaces, do it yourself (DIY) analytics, and new formats for data  collection and storage including No-SQL databases, cube and clusters, etc.    Availability of Research on these Topics      Recent ICIS,  AMCIS,  and  DSI  conferences  had  extensive  research  presentations  on  Enterprise systems, the expanding enterprise ecosystem  and their  integration with emergent  innovations.  This well-established research track has achieved its 20th year at HICSS. Current  indications are that the enterprise eco-system is transforming and expanding. This transformative  growth  is  to  extend  and  adapt  to  assimilate  many  emerging  technologies  including  Cloud  Computing,  inter-organizational  systems  (IOS),  financial  technologies  (Blockchain),  greater  automation, augmentation with ML and AI and other integration methods. Additionally, enterprise  integration has now reached into all size companies including small and medium enterprises, and  supply chain partners increasingly seek cross-organizational integration. We expect the expansion  of the enterprise eco-system and the evolving nature of integrated systems should attract additional  researchers to this broadly inclusive topic area.    Marketing plan (How we plan to solicit papers)    We  are  taking  a  multi-pronged  approach  to  marketing  this  track  including  seeking  participation from industry practitioners to collaborate with researchers. This will also include  general announcements to academic organization members, targeted contacts with current and  emerging researchers in the topic area (based on past proceedings and publications in the topic  area), sharing the call for papers at major conferences and professional events, and contacting users  of ERP-related resources  at universities. Our call  for papers will  be shared at  face to face  conferences when those are resumed (such as ICIS, AMCIS, ECIS and DSI conferences). A mini- track announcement will be shared with members of leading professional academic organization  members through use of the Association of Information Systems (AIS) listserv emailing system,  through the AAA accounting information systems section members and possibly through AIS  special  interest  groups  via  emails  and  at  conferences.  A  survey  of  recent  proceedings  and  publications in the topic area will be used to create a more targeted email list to send out the mini- track announcement. We will send communication about this track to recent authors on Enterprise  systems related integration topics. Announcements will be shared with faculty at SAP University  Alliance schools, and to faculty researchers who make use of enterprise systems educational  resources.    2        Sample Call for Papers     ----------------------  Call for Papers  Enterprise Ecosystem: Extending and Integrating Technology Serving the Enterprise     Mini-track:  HICSS 2022    The  focus  of  this  mini-track  begins  with  the  organizational  Enterprise  System  as  a  foundation for an integrated Enterprise Ecosystem which is often directly connected to suppliers  and  customers.  These  Enterprise  Systems  must  integrate  emerging  technologies  to  achieve  competitive advantage in day to day operations. Building on the data collected in ERP, data  analysis can be used to leverage Big Data and enhance evidence-based decision making. As the  technology landscape continues to change quickly, many new innovations impact Enterprise  Systems and continued research is needed. The integrated Enterprise Ecosystem is impacted and  must adapt to: cloud computing, sustainability, financial technologies, non-financial metrics, inter- organizational  integration  and  more.  Integrated  enterprise  systems  are  further  enabled  by  extensions related to the Internet of Things (IoT), new Big Data information sources such as  Geolocation/GIS data, telemetry, hi resolution media content and storing metadata. Data analytics  tools are offered by Enterprise vendors, in the cloud and in the data center – how does the  Enterprise ecosystem need to evolve to support and enhance the ability to perform analytics?  Heavily integrating the supply chain demands other extensions to processes, business  transactions, and data privacy/security to provide functionality to integrate with partner companies  and effectively serve customers. Linking various emerging technologies and diverse systems  together is the objective of this track on the expanded Enterprise Ecosystem.  This mini-track seeks  to explore issues, both academic and organizational, surrounding the evolution of the integrated  enterprise system – All manner of themes related to internal and external integration of Enterprise  Systems.  This  spans  topics  from  management,  organizational,  social,  project  and  process  management, supply chain, and absorbing a wide range of emerging technologies into the core  ERP systems. Investigation is needed to support the rapid change of enterprise business operations,  automation, and integration with business partners.      Papers accepted for presentation at HICSS in this OS: Enterprise Ecosystem minitrack  with an accounting component will be considered by track chairs for fasttrack submission  to the International Journal of Accounting Information Systems (IJAIS).    A broad set of research topics and questions address the expanded and integrated enterprise eco- system.

However, without the proper organizational capabilities and skills to put these digital assets to effective use, organizations are at significant risk of wasting their investments and missing key opportunities for growth and competitiveness.  Against this context, the “IT governance and its mechanisms” research mini-track focuses on the design and implementation of organizational capabilities and e-leadership skills required to be successful in digital innovation and transformation journeys.  Since 2001, we are chairing this “IT Governance and its mechanisms” research track at HICSS, in order to advance research and practice in this area. Already with a tradition of 20 years, the research track focuses on the organizational challenges of governing and managing the digital assets and enterprise. In this knowledge area, the emphasis is on how organizations enable both business and IT people to execute their responsibilities in support of business/IT alignment and the creation of business value from IT-enabled investments.    Short mintrack description  In many organizations, information technology has become crucial in the support, sustainability and growth of their businesses. The pervasive use of technology has created a critical dependency on IT that calls for a specific focus on IT Governance or Enterprise Governance of IT. Enterprise Governance of IT (EGIT) is an integral part of enterprise governance exercised by the Board overseeing the definition and implementation of processes, structures and relational mechanism in the organization enabling both business and IT people to execute their responsibilities in support of business/IT alignment and the creation of business value from IT-enabled business investments. The mini-track “IT governance and its mechanisms” is soliciting papers on theories, models and practices in the IT governance domain and aims to contribute to the understanding of IT governance and its structures, processes and relational mechanisms.

The minitrack follows our six years of  successful exploration of this topic since HICSS-49 (see Russell et al. 2021).    It is well understood that, in order to compete and survive, organizations have to consider  platform- and ecosystem-centric perspectives. Today, digital technologies shape firm  identities, physical and digital resources merge, and even traditionally physical industries  become “digital first” (e.g., Wessel et al. 2021, Baskerville et al. 2020). Platforms and  ecosystems play a central role in the rapid emergence and proliferation of the technologies  that afford this digital transformation (e.g., human-machine ecosystems, digital twins, cloud  services, artificial intelligence, 5G).     Although understanding the value and importance of platforms and ecosystems across  various industries and domains has grown significantly over the years, there is still a paucity  of research examining the dynamic and evolutionary aspects. Building on last year’s  experience, we seek contributions that focus on the “dynamic” aspects of platforms and  ecosystems. How do platforms and ecosystems emerge and what are the mechanisms  driving their evolution? How do platforms and ecosystems adapt to changes in the  technological, social, economic, ecologic, or political environment? How can specific  platform and ecosystem actors succeed within these dynamics and manage even  unintended consequences?    The minitrack seeks contributions that problematize or build on diverse theoretical  backgrounds such as management science, information systems, computer science,  decision science, system science, organizational design, policy making, and behavioral  economics to continue the scholarly exploration of concepts, theories, models, and tools for  managing platforms and ecosystems. We are open to a wide set of methodological  approaches including empirical research, case-based research, field studies, design  science, behavioral decision-making experiments, and conceptual research. We encourage  collaboration between academia, industry, and policy making and welcome submissions  from industry and around the world.    For the minitrack call, we encourage topics of interest associated with such inquiries and  beyond:    ● Theories, models, and empirical studies of platform and ecosystem dynamics  ● Taxonomies, vocabularies, ontologies, and other forms of shared language to  exchange knowledge on platforms and ecosystems  ● Open and closed resources in the dynamics of platforms and ecosystems, including  emergent roles of boundary resources, software, and data  ● Innovation in platforms and ecosystems  ● (In)stability of identity for platforms, ecosystems, and actors over time  ● Change of power, autonomy and control in platforms and ecosystems  ● Evolving platform and ecosystem business models  ● Mechanisms driving the dynamics, growth, and evolution of platforms and  ecosystems  ● Technological and competitive disruption in ecosystems  ● Orchestration strategies for platforms and ecosystem  ● Studies on the unintended consequences of (micro)mechanisms on platform and  ecosystem success (or failure)  ● Approaches for controlling the power of the network effects and mitigating their  unintended consequences  ● Dynamic analytics, visualization, and decision support for platform and ecosystems  ● New methods to study platform and ecosystem management    Bibliography    Baskerville, R.

Fourth, we will continue to engage  with the platform and ecosystem research community through social media to ensure the  visibility of the minitrack. Fifth, we will address our growing minitrack community of authors  and reviewers to follow up with the research published through the minitrack.  The organizations of the minitrack co-chairs endorse their involvement and will pay for their  travel and registration cost to attend HICSS 2021. "
"HICSS-54","OS","Organizational Systems and Technology","a81e8e85-6a4a-464c-aa4d-1931a947cb77","Practice-based IS Research"," Proposal: HICSS-55 (2022) Minitrack: Practice-based IS Research  Description  This minitrack seeks to encourage practice-based research on new and emerging IS issues in organizations. Practice-based research aspires to bridge the gap between academic theory and practice. It aspires to introduce researchers to state-of-the-art practices and issues from industry and introduce managers to research that makes sense of and bring coherence to the issues they face. The methods used in practice-based research are often exploratory field-based studies involving interviews, observations, and practice data. The intense pressure to achieve methodological distinction and theoretical contribution often results in current practice-based topics being eschewed by researchers because the topics themselves are not mature enough in practice to attain desirable samples or sample sizes, nor are they conducive to theorizing since so little is known. These are precisely the reasons that exploratory, practice-based research can play a tremendous role in helping establish and lay the foundations of a research domain while providing insights into an emerging topic.  The objective of this minitrack is to encourage practice-based research in information systems and disseminate the results of that research in a manner that makes its relevance and utility readily apparent.  This minitrack invites authors to submit in-depth research that provides rich stories, unique insights, and useful conceptual frameworks for information systems practice. Papers might be based upon single cases, multiple cases, field interviews, or, less commonly, literature itself.  Experimental research and survey research are less likely to achieve the goal of providing rich insight for practice.  While it is assumed that researchers are guided by theory, it is not expected that the submissions to this minitrack make distinct or novel theoretical contributions.  The contributions should focus on distinct and unique lessons for practice.  The minitrack chairs coordinate with MIS Quarterly Executive (MISQE) in selecting papers for fast-tracking to an issue of MISQE. Overall, this minitrack aims to: Showcase high-quality practice-oriented IS research Promote practice-oriented IS research as a key source of insight and guidance for digital leaders Provide researchers a platform to present and discuss their practice-oriented IS research findings and expose the community to current challenges in creating value with IT Help identify the most challenging managerial issues for digital/IT leaders and frame them as new questions that could guide future practice-oriented IS research.   Additional guidance for authors of practice-based IS research papers This practice track has run for a number of years at HICSS. We are not just seeking research with strong relevance for practitioners, but manuscripts that are written in a way that makes them easily accessible to such a reader. This means that any accepted manuscript will not follow the traditional “rules” of writing for an academic audience. If you are not a regular reader of MISQ Executive, we would advise you to read a few articles to get a sense of their style, structure, focus, and content. Some general guidelines for writing such articles include: Simplify reality, but do not be simplistic Keep theory and methodology in the background (perhaps include your methods in an appendix, but write it so that it is accessible to non-academic readers). Use literature and in-depth evidence to give credibility and generalizability. Typically, such articles loosely follow this structure: Short lead-in Motivate the practitioner reader in 2-3 sentences. Why should they read the article? What you write should resonate closely with them; perhaps it is a problem that they recognize that you are now going to help them solve. Short introduction to the topic Frame the topic of the article. Use footnotes rather than traditional academic referencing style when using prior research. Extensive research findings Use headings and figures/tables to communicate findings. Address solutions to managerial challenges. Present lessons learned from the research and recommendations. Possibly develop and/or use a practice-oriented framework to organize and present findings.  Actionable guidelines Actionable guidelines include action verbs, not passive verbs like “understand,” “assess, “think,” or “get commitment.”  Tell the reader what to actually do, or what to change.  For example, if getting commitment is important, say how to get the required level of commitment. Appendix Present an overview of research methods. Remember to write in a way that is accessible to an audience unfamiliar with academic research's nuances.  Fast Track to MISQE Selected articles will be fast-tracked to MISQE. There are typically several MISQE senior editors in the audience to offer guidance on presented articles. Marketing As in the past, this session will be marketed through AISWorld and the MISQ Executive website. Minitrack Proposal co-chairs:  Bill Kettinger (primary chair) William S.

Call for Papers: Strategy, Information, Technology, Economics, and Society (SITES)    This Minitrack addresses the interactions between technology and changes in consumer  behavior, between consumer behavior and changes in corporate strategy, and between  corporate strategy and regulatory policy. The intent is to understand how technology affects  strategy, how strategy affects regulation, the law, and social welfare, and how regulation and  the law can best serve the interests of society. In addition to Economics and IS, we seek to  engage a broader range of Social Sciences, including Anthropology, Sociology, Psychology,  Public Policy and, of course, the Law. Each year, the SITES Minitrack produces a Special Issue  or Section of papers that are published in the Journal of Management Information Systems  (JMIS), a Financial Times 50 journal.    The Minitrack explores topics in IS, Economics, Strategy, and Public Policy, including but not  limited to:    •  The new and evolving economics of uncertainty and information. Who are the “winners”?  Who are the “losers”? Can interactions be designed, including possible regulatory  intervention, to improve anticipated or observed outcomes?  •  Case studies of the application of strategic IS and their impacts on firms, markets and  economies  •  Economic analysis of investments in IS in a wide range of competitive and commercial  application areas, and the relationships between systems use and market share,  profitability, business value or other measures of competitive advantage and firm  performance  •  Strategic analysis of IT and cloud computing services, sourcing, and contracts  •  Business strategy on the Internet, electronic markets and digital convergence  •  Property rights, incomplete contracts, transaction costs and other theories to understand  interorganizational IS  •  Channel development, transformation and conflict in the presence of emerging  technologies  •  Product design with IT, and the bundling and pricing of physical and digital goods and  services  •  Technology innovations, process disruptions and business transformation associated  with the Fintech Revolution    The Minitrack will also include a wide range of topics that may not be explicitly grounded in  Economics. They include:    •  Privacy and privacy policies, including studies of consumer preferences and attitudes,  and regulatory policies designed to balance the needs of the State for stability and self- preservation and the desires of citizens for anonymity and privacy  •  Social networks and the changing nature of real-world relationships, including but not  limited to changes in dating, and relationships between employees and their  organizations, and between employees at competing organizations based on prior social  connections  •  Changes in competition law, antitrust law, and regulation, based on new online business  models, including the new practices of the sharing economy  •  Social networks, social change, ranging from increased social cohesion to violent regime  change, as well as social welfare in light of tech innovations in society    Potential authors are welcome to contact the Co-Chairs to assess whether their paper will be  appropriate for the Minitrack any time after March 15. The deadline for final submission is mid- June, in keeping with the overall deadline that the HICSS Conference organizers enforce.  Authors who are interested in attending, but only to make a presentation and not have their  papers included in the HICSS conference proceedings are also welcome to contact the Co- Chairs, to discuss what they wish to propose.    Marketing Plan:    The SITES Minitrack has had a long history at HICSS of offering strong developmental  reviewing, helpful and thorough feedback for authors, a lively presentation and discussion  environment, and a follow-up JMIS Special Issue of articles that are handled in fast-track mode  for publication. This brings many people out year after year, who are interested in competing for  the limited number of JMIS slots, and for the opportunity to present their research to an  interested and committed audience.     Each year the Co-Chairs also reach out with invitations to new authors, to those who have  presented in the past (including their Ph.D. students), and to people who can bring new topics to  SITES under the general umbrella of the Minitrack’s Call for Papers. We also share the Call for  Papers widely, by posting it in a variety of lists and sharing it with faculty colleagues worldwide.  We also occasionally bring industry participants into the Minitrack for panel discussions and  debates, although no commitments have ever been made to wave registration fees, pay for  transportation, hotel stays, or per-diem expenses.

The 55th HICSS, one of the most prominent conferences on Information Systems and Sciences worldwide, will be held January 4-7, 2022 at Hyatt Regency, Maui ().  In this mini track, we seek to address advances in research on how information systems can be designed, developed, implemented, and governed for social impact. We are interested in how information systems improve or worsen societal, organizational, group, and individual challenges. How can information systems be designed to protect human dignity? How can information systems be governed to promote emancipatory outcomes? How does information systems use affect individual and collective empowerment? How can the trajectory of oppressive trends be altered using information systems?   We welcome papers that theoretically or empirically advance our understanding of different forms of social impact in technology-mediated environments. Papers can use any acceptable methodology and theory. We welcome papers at any level of analysis and encourage papers that take a cross-level and/or inter-disciplinary perspective. Some possible topic areas include but are not limited to the following:   Emancipatory Design Theories  Corporate social responsibility Digital activism/Social movements Worker oppression/Individual subjugation to information systems Human dignity/emancipation/empowerment Digital divide/Digital equity Fake news/Political polarization online Social collective and connective action Malevolent organizing online/Terrorism Internet governance  Political digitalization/E-government  Cyberwarfare and the weaponization of non-military technologies Social inclusion and marginalization  ICT for development Digital philanthropy and data philanthropy Digital innovation in social welfare organizations Digital saviors and dangerous champions Marketing Plan:  This track attracted high-quality papers for HICSS-54 and we received enough papers to maintain a 46% acceptance rate. We hope to recruit even more submissions for 2022. We will keep the name Social Impact and Information Systems. We will continue to publicize this mini-track to audiences close to our respective backgrounds – management information systems, accounting information systems, and communication. Efforts will also be made to reach social science and information science audiences. We will employ MIS, IS, IT, and Communication “call for papers” distribution lists and professional organization listservs. We will engage in promotion to similar and related audiences on Facebook and LinkedIn. We will send out a call for papers in March, April, May and early June. Specifically, we will announce the mini track monthly on AISworld, OCISnet, and to the AIS special interest group SIG-Social Inclusion. We will also send individual emails to past authors in this and other related minitracks from both HICSS and other conferences, as well as emails to authors discovered from a targeted search in this area.    Minitrack Co-Chairs: Amber G.

(Organizational Systems and Technology track)    The “Informing Research: Where to Now?” mini-track invites submissions which address the challenge of  exploring where to now, given what we now know. The Informing research genre synthesizes existing  research to focus attention on “new phenomena, disclos[ing] new perspectives on phenomena, and  illuminat[ing] new research agendas and programs” (Hovorka et al. 2018).  While literature reviews of  prior publications synthesize what we already know, they often lock our theorizing in place even when  researchers  are  faced  with  somehow  integrating  novel  phenomenon  or  new  socio-technical  configurations.  Theoretical  contradictions,  incommensurability  and  blind  acceptance  of  received  theoretical wisdom hamper our ability to understand, integrate and synthesize the exponentially growing  body of scientific literature in the social sciences. Reviews provide attentive images of the present state  of knowledge, but our research only rarely provides attentive images of where our knowledge can go.  Thus the importance of Informing research.    Papers in the Informing research mini-track will begin by problematizing what is known regarding specific  challenges (Alvesson and Sandberg 2020). Problematizing provides the background to identify what is a  way forward and what is worth knowing by surfacing both problematic assumptions that no longer hold,  and also problematic contextual or technological development that threatens what we know or reveal  what we don’t know. For example, development of theory ontologies would benefit the field by  identifying what we can now research, given what we already know; Theory integration between  disciplines could keep the IS field moving forward by bridging boundaries or organizing our theories to be  accessible to practice; Natural language processing, data mining and predictive analytics can be used to  interrogate large theory corpora revealing contradictions and potential paths forward. New methods in  data collection and analysis, new categories of knowledge, and new phenomenon all challenge us to to  address emerging phenomenon and challenges on the background of our accumulated knowledge.     While the possible methodological approaches of the papers in this mini-track are quite broad, this year  we wish to focus on the specific challenges presented below. Accepted papers must present new research  perspectives, conceptualizations or approaches to phenomena. The papers will excel in investigating the  intersection of disciplines, provoking new directions for inquiry, and affording opportunities.  They will  endeavor to advance a shared understanding of how technologies and systems shape and become the  world we inhabit. Toward these ends, topics of interest (and example existing research) in this year’s mini- track include:    1. The relationships between algorithmic decisions systems (AI) and humans with specific emphasis  on what these relationships reveal about humanity (see for example: Demetis and Lee 2018; Rhee  2018).  2. Creating ontologies, taxonomies, or categorizations of concepts and constructs that could create  theoretical ties between different disciplines (e.g. politics, surveillance and privacy (Hafermalz  2020; Leidner and Tona 2021; Susskind 2018); IS systems and ecosystems (Bogers et al. 2019; Wang  2021); socio-technical systems and conceptions of work, tasks, and living (Ingold 2000; Leclercq- Vandelannoitte and Aroles 2020; Wang et al. 2020).  3. How can academic knowledge enable progress towards future liveable worlds by imagining threats  and alternatives extending into the future ? (Hovorka and Peter 2021; Krznaric 2020)  4. Other challenges may be considered – please consult with the mini-track co-chairs.    Prospective authors are advised that the track does not look for topical literature reviews which are best  submitted to one of the conference’s topical tracks Papers in this mini-track must explicitly provide the  basis for more speculative future-leaning conceptualizations of phenomenon.      For further conference details, schedules and submission guidelines please see:   http://www.hicss.org/  We hope to see you on Maui in January 2022!  Mahalo!  Mini-track Co-Chairs:  Dirk S.

Mini-Track Co-chairs  The “Theories in IS” mini-track has been part of the Organizational Systems and Technology track for 15  years and has slowly been reconfigured to “Informing Research”. The conveners are able to attract 9-15  submissions annually resulting in 1-2 sessions at HICSS each year. 2021 had 9 submissions with three  acceptance. Papers from the mini-track have been published in highly ranked Information Systems  journals and a special issue in JAIS (2018).   As a result of this history, the co-chairs can access a network of prior submitters and authors as well as  the larger system science community which engages in the technological and philosophical aspects of  “what can we now do?”   A/P Dirk S Hovorka is an Associate Professor in Business Information Systems Discipline at the  University of Sydney. His current research seeks to recenter the possible livable worlds which scientific  practices bring forth through theory, design practices, and how we think about ‘the future’ in terms of  technology, society, and geographies. His research interrogation of the philosophical foundations of  Information Systems has been informed by his Information Systems PhD and Interdisciplinary  Telecommunications and Geology MS degrees (University of Colorado, USA). As the recipient the Beta  Gamma Sigma (AACSB International Honor Society) 2018 Professor of the Year Award and the University  of Sydney Wayne Lonergan Award for Outstanding Teaching, Dirk is deeply committed to preparing  students for challenges of the future(s) they are entering. Dirk co-authored the AIS 2011 Best Paper  ""Secondary Design: A Case of Behavioral Design Research"" and the JAIS Best Paper 2011. He is a JAIS  Senior Editor, a CAIS Associate Editor, and HICSS co-chair of the ""Knowing What We Know (Theories in  IS)"" mini-track.  The University of Sydney endorses my involvement has funding available for Dirk to attend HICSS55.  Benjamin Mueller is an Associate Professor of Digital Innovation and Design at the University of  Lausanne, Switzerland, and an Associate Researcher at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany.  His research and teaching focus on how advanced information and communication technologies  transform organizations. He pays particular attention to mechanisms through which individuals augment  their work with technology and the corresponding organizational benefits. His research is published in  journals such as the MIS Quarterly, the Journal of Management Information Systems, the Journal of the  Association for Information Systems, and the Journal of Business Research, among others. Beyond his  work one the “Knowing what we know” mini-track at HICSS, Benjamin has long been involved in the  disciplines reflection on theory and theorizing by working with the Journal of the Association for  Information Systems and serving as a track co-chair for “IS Foundations” at ICIS 2017 and “Advancing  Theories and Theorizing in IS Research” at ECIS (2014-2016).  Benjamin does not need his university’s endorsement because he can pay for the trip with his chair’s  budget.    •  Marketing plan, i.e., how do you plan to solicit papers  We will be contacting prior authors and using the network of researchers from the  HICSS/ECIS/ICIS Theory tracks who we know are interested in these ideas.     •  A statement that your organization endorses your involvement and will pay for your travel   Our respective Universities support our involvement and we have travel funds to support the  trip.

Advances in digital technologies have been adapted by organizations in a large-scale effort to develop productivity, retain and attract a valuable workforce and talent, and increase both efficiency and effectiveness. The recent advances include but are not limited to the usage of blockchain technology, people analytics, the wide spread of digital platforms, the algorithmic control and management of workforce, sophisticated robotics and deep learning algorithms, and many other forms of advanced technology in order to enhance or augment various internal and external activities, work processes such as decision-making, coordination, and control. Furthermore, the resulting changes in the workplace from the COVID-19 pandemic have led many organizations to adapt by utilizing technology such as computer mediated teaming and telework (i.e., videoconferencing). These changes to the broader work environment have wide spanning implications for future of, even after the pandemic has subsided. The changes in the organizational life and beyond may be so large that some of our current theorizing on the digital technologies may not be valid in a few years of time.  Although all of these aspects have enabled companies to adapt to the changing environment, they require more vigilance and mindfulness that have put a premium on shedding insight into trust as well as distrust. Trust is positive expectation of the conduct of the other party in a specific situation involving perceived risk or vulnerability. Distrust is a negative expectation regarding the conduct of the other party in the specific situation involving perceived risk or vulnerability. It is now well accepted that trust and distrust are two different constructs with their own antecedents and pathways. There is much interest in the topics of distrust as well as trust in technologically complex environments that involve the many layers of technical and social elements. We need to increase our understanding about distrust and trust at different levels of analysis, i.e., individuals, teams, organizations, meta-organizations and society.  We welcome papers that theoretically or empirically advance our understanding by addressing advances in distrust and trust research and digital technologies in organizations as well as society at large. Papers can use any acceptable methodology and theory. We welcome papers at any level of analysis and encourage papers that take a cross-level and/or interdisciplinary perspective. Some possible topic areas include but are not limited to the following:  Different forms of distrust and trust and the future of work on digital platforms and in organizations  How does distrust and trust research helps us to make sense out of the changes in the workplace from the COVID-19 pandemic? Understanding distrust and trust, the explainability of AI, and algorithmic transparency Understanding how distrust and trust in organizations is affected by computer-mediated teaming Understanding distrust, vigilance and surveillance in telework as well as people analytics Understanding issues of digital trust, reputation, and risk in the context of computer mediated teams and other platform-based organizations, e.g., in the digital platform, among the users of the platform, in the organization behind the platform, in financial and other transactions conducted through the platform. Understanding virtual reality, avatars, and distrust/trust research Understanding trust in AI and distrust/trust in work contexts in which organizations and platforms employ algorithmic management and algorithmic control Understanding the role of distrust and trust in the development of algorithms, e.g., functions, openness of coding, data collection. Understanding the relationship between an organization’s handling of its users’ data, e.g., privacy/integrity/security, use of the cloud, and trust in the organization How do changes in distrust/trust influence identity and identification processes? Understanding the role of distrust/trust between users and emerging technologies, e.g., teleconferencing, personal robots, smart toys, wearables, personal voice assistants, 3D printing, autonomous vehicles, drones. Understanding the relationship between disrust and trust and the development and dynamics of self-regulated, decentralized, peer-to-peer networks. How does distrust and trust change in blockchain technology and cryptography contexts?  How does distrust and trust evolve in complex and multi-layered environments such as digital platforms? Understanding the relationship between distrust/trust, identity, control, and influence in digital environments. Understanding the role of AI and disrust/trust in complex organizational decision making Understanding how norms and policies at organizational level influence distrust/trust in AI or automation development and adoption  Trust is an interdisciplinary research area. Co-minitrack chairs include accomplished scholars on trust beyond information systems including management and psychology.   Marketing Plan: We will announce the minitrack monthly on AISworld, OCISnet, EGOS and FINT network (global network for over 700 trust researchers), AOM divisions and Human Factors listserv as soon as the minitrack is approved. We will also send individual emails to past authors on this and other related minitracks as well as our colleagues worldwide who are interested in this area.

Prior	 to	becoming	an	entrepreneur,	Alex	was	a	graduate	student	in	Game	Theory	at	Caltech	and	 released	the	first	commercial	Nash	Equilibrium	solver	for	Poker.	 	     Background  An	agile	approach	focuses	on	using	a	cycle	of	experimentation,	inspection	and	adaptation	to	 improve	production.	Agile	is	most	often	applied	to	software	development,	and	we	expect	 many	papers	in	this	mini-track	to	discuss	software	organizations	and	software	engineering	 practices.	However,	we	also	welcome	papers	that	describe	other	types	of	organizational	 “production”,	such	as	business	intelligence,	management	initiatives,	manufacturing,	 marketing,	sales	and	finance.	 A	lean	approach	focuses	rapid	experiments	by	trying	to	continually	reduce	waste	and	 minimizing	work-in-progress.	Lean	has	recently	been	popularized	as	a	construct	for	start- up	organizations	(“Lean	Startup”	or	“Lean	Entrepreneurship”).			Advocates	claim	a	lean	 approach	produces	greater	market	satisfaction	and	customer	engagement,	earlier	 discovery	of	hidden	market	opportunities,	higher	revenues	and	more	efficient	use	of	 development	staff.	 These	approaches	claim	superiority	in	new	product	development	over	traditional	 approaches	(such	as	“waterfall	management”)	that	fail	to	test	development	and	market	 assumptions	in	long-range	plans.	 Agile	and	lean	approaches	challenge	organizations	large	and	small.	People	typically	 conflate	small	failures	(learning)	with	large	failures	(organizational	threats),	assume	that	 innovation	means	taking	long-range	untested	risk,	and	establish	and	protect	budgets	with	 many	baked-in	production	and	market	assumptions.	These	cultural	realities	interfere	with	 agility	and	real	innovation.	 As	a	result,	companies	often	invest	enormous	amounts	of	money	in	incomplete	or	 abandoned	agile	transformations.	What	can	organizations	do	to	improve	agile	uptake?	How	 do	we	know	that	the	organization	is	improving?	How	can	organizations	diagnose	problems	 without	motivating	gaming?	What	types	of	people	are	more	likely	to	thrive	in	agile	and	lean	 organizations,	and	what	roles	should	they	take?	What	hiring	practices	result	in	better	 candidates?	What	training	programs	produce	better	results?	What	coaching	structures	 work?	How	do	we	measure	these	activities?	 Marketing Plan  •  Solicit	key	influencers	in	agile	and	lean	practices.	This	will	combine	mailing	lists	 from	the	mini-track	co-chairs,	who	are	active	in	the	Scrum,	agile	and	lean	academic	 and	professional	communities.	 •  Continue	a	practice	of	marketing	HICSS	as	a	place	where	“systems	thinkers”	get	 together,	from	a	variety	of	fields.	Attendees	and	speakers	will	benefit	from	exposure	 to	more	fields	(and	markets	for	their	research).	 •  Market	this	session	and	venue	as	a	place	where	the	agile/lean	academics	and	 professionals	can	meet,	discuss	and	collaborate	on	agile	and	lean	startup	 implementations	for	enterprises,	small	groups	and	individuals.

The pandemic amplified this trend. Numerous startups are currently developing blockchain enabled enterprise applications for addressing supply chain and safety issues unique to the new reality of social distancing and contact tracing.  Blockchain indeed represents a paradigm shift from centralized computing to decentralized. The intense interests in blockchain center around the decentralized system’s ability to provide transparency, security, (pseudo-) anonymity and data integrity without any third-party organization in control of the transactions; it thus can enable trustless transactions and disintermediated societies. This minitrack aims at providing a forum for addressing the challenges arising from the paradigm shift and the “how to” of engineering an enterprise blockchain system that can fundamentally change how business value is created, discovered, and realized. Different from other minitracks that mainly focus on the use cases of blockchain technology, the main focus of this minitrack is on the design and engineering issues of enterprise blockchain systems.  This minitrack calls for research on blockchain engineering.  Topics include but are not limited to:   Blockchain system analysis and design addressing paradigm shifts, including technical, organizational, legal and social aspects Agile processes for blockchain software development Practice-based blockchain system development:  case studies, cost/benefit analysis, etc. Tools for blockchain system development and community management Scalability, security and dependability in blockchain and smart contracts Architecting blockchain platforms  Blockchain enabled trustless computing Advancement of core techniques, including consensus mechanisms, incentive mechanisms, decentralized governance policies, smart contract engineering, etc. New Dapps (Decentralized applications) and business models enabled by blockchains  Engineering blockchain combined with advanced technologies, including Big Data, Operating Systems, Artificial Intelligence, and Internet of Things (IoT) Economic comparisons of blockchain technology with the traditional  Etc.   Marketing plan, i.e., how do you plan to solicit papers:  Blockchain-related topics have drawn significant attention from academics and practitioners.   This minitrack is particularly suited for Software Technology Track at HICSS because of its focus on the “engineering” aspect of blockchain which complements other blockchain-related minitracks in HICSS which focus on the applications of the technology.  We plan to market this minitrack to Computer Science, Software Engineering, and IS departments of major universities in the world as well as blockchain divisions in enterprises and professional service providers, including outsourcers.

Minitrack Title    Cyber Security and Software Assurance    2. Descriptive Paragraph  Modern society is irreversibly dependent on software systems of astonishing scope and  complexity.  Yet despite best efforts, errors, vulnerabilities, failures, and compromises  continue to persist.  Networked systems with complex hardware and software  components embody many pathways that adversaries can exploit.   Experience shows  that contemporary cybersecurity and software assurance methods are insufficient to  meet this challenge.  Each day, cybersecurity demands our attention.  From working on  laptops to loading apps on phones to evaluating the safety of software-enabled devices,  we must decide how best to protect information and services in an enlightened  approach that balances practical issues of cost and functionality.   There is increasing  recognition of the need for rigorous foundations for cybersecurity and software  assurance.  This minitrack focuses on how to enable development and application of  these foundations.  We ask: How should research and development move us toward a  solid basis in understanding and principle?  The goal is to develop science foundations,  technologies, and practices that can improve the security and dependability of complex  systems.  This minitrack will bring together researchers in cybersecurity and software    1  assurance in a multidisciplinary approach to these problems. This min-track nomination  was selected as best paper for the HICSS-48 Software Track.    Our minitrack invites work embracing multiple perspectives, levels of abstraction, and  evaluation of best practices and policies that help us to understand and assure the  security of complex systems. We welcome papers about tools and techniques in that  apply scientific and rigorous approaches or reveal underlying commonalities and  constructs.      3. Proposed Technical Areas    This  minitrack  addresses  all  aspects  of  cybersecurity  viewed  from  an  “enlightened  security” perspective. The following topics will be included in the minitrack:    •  Security ecosystem  •  Designed-in security  •  Tailored trustworthy spaces  •  Moving target  •  Cyber economics  •  Science of security  •  Multivariate detection and response  •  Co-evolution of defense and offense  •  Biologically-inspired security models  •  Holistic risk analysis  •  Hardware-enabled trust  •  Layered adaptable defense  •  Real-time coordinated response  •  Automated system interoperability  •  Authentication in ecosystem  •  Practical use of continuous monitoring  •  Confidence in activity prediction  •  Security visualization and prediction  •  Theories of vulnerability classification and control  •  Security measurement  •  Advances in information assurance theory and practice  •  Advances in specification, design, and implementation of assured systems  •  Advances in verification, testing, and certification of assured systems   •  Advances in software security analysis   •  Assurance for embedded systems and hardware components  •  Assurance for large-scale infrastructure systems  •  Information and software assurance in cloud computing environments  •  Assurance in system maintenance and evolution  •  Automated methods for information and software assurance  •  Assurance through computation of software behavior  •  Management of assurance operations  •  Processes and metrics for information and software assurance   •  Business case and ROI development for information and software assurance    2  •  Supply chain and standards issues in information and software assurance  •  Case studies of system assurance successes  •  Software testing        4.  Other Conferences    A number of other conferences address cyber security, for example:      •  Black Hat  •  IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy  •  Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC)  •  RSA  •  CSIIRW – Cyber Security and Information Intelligence Workshop  •  International Conference on Software Engineering  •  Software Assurance Forum   •  Annual Symposium on Information Assurance  •  International Conference on Information Assurance  •  AIAA Infotech Aerospace Conference    In general, these conferences tend to focus on individual aspects of security, attacks,  and countermeasures. Our vision for the HICSS Minitrack is to bring together a broad  spectrum  of  participants  in  assurance  research  and  application,  to  promote  cross- fertilization of methods in diverse subject-matter application areas. Technologies applied  and lessons learned in one subject-matter area may well inform advances in another.  Our goal is to help create a cross-discipline community of researchers that will continue  to  participate  in  HICSS  in  subsequent  years.  With  its  broad  focus  and  diverse  participation, HICSS is an ideal conference to play a leading role in improving the state- of-art in software and system assurance.      5.

Minitrack Marketing Plan The co-chairs will expand on their prior year’s goal of expanding advertising reach through their program and technical committees.  Technical committee membership is intended to be 10 and include the minitrack co-chairs.  Aside from the co-chairs, confirmed TPC members include Dr. Will Williamson (NPS); CDR Thomas Parker, USN, PhD (U.S. Fleet Cyber Command; Dr. Paul Beery (NPS); Dr. David Reed (Naval Sea Systems Command), and Dr. Richard Poland (Savannah River National Lab).  The program committee continues to grow their personal networks despite COVID.  The co-chairs will engage existing research sponsors and ongoing research collaborators including Savannah River National Laboratory, the Office of Naval Research, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Naval Sea Systems Command, and the Naval Research Laboratory to make minitrack submissions. During HICSS 54, the minitrack expanded their contribution network to include Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) and UT San Antonio.  Additionally, we will advertise the minitrack at the Naval Research Working Group, a Navy-wide research and development synchronization conference hosted in April.   We will continue expanding last year’s mini-track social media marketing campaign leveraging LinkedIn and multi-disciplinary conference advertising sites such as PaperCrowd and Wikicfp.  Other marketing methods: Dr. Scrofani's role as a research center director affords him national visibility and frequent engagement with the academic, national lab, and industry communities interested in these research areas.  His organization has stimulated research and development within these communities via several public broad agency announcements, culminating in the award of several Department of Defense (DoD) grants.  A consequence of these activities is that he maintains an expansive network of organizations that conduct research in the areas of this minitrack and could submit relevant papers.  Dr. Scrofani teaches and advises in the National Capital Region, providing access to alternative and independent groups of sponsors and researchers and facilitating strong ties with academics and professionals at DoD, NSA, NGA, and other cyber-interested agencies. Drs. Roth, Hale, and Bollmann teach and advise at NPS in Monterey, CA and can solicit interest from students and fellow professors through relationships, faculty meetings, and the Master’s Student Seminar. Dr. Hale is an active member of the Consortium for Intelligent Systems Education and Research (CISER) at NPS and provides educational support for the Joint AI Center (JAIC) of the DoD, providing access to a wide range of researchers working on innovative cyber solutions.

The data sources have increased manifold and by 2021 it is estimated that there were 4.6 billion Internet users, the vast majority of whom are always connected, and 8 billion connected IoT devices in our homes, cities, monitoring critical infrastructures, automobiles, earthquake faults, etc. Add to this immense volume of digital library, research data in nearly all academic fields; and personal medical data. It is expected by 2025 the world’s Internet data will be 175 zettabytes. That’s 175x1021 bytes.  Among the long list of practitioners and technologists who must analyze and extract knowledge from this data we find members of large Internet companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple; Telecommunication Companies; governments at all levels; Manufacturing; Advertising and Marking; Heath Care; Biomedical, and Pharmaceutical companies; and their complementary research communities.  Each requires the use of a subset of the available state-of-the-art Data Analytic algorithms to extract their desired knowledge. For each such domain specific instance of these algorithms, the knowledge they extract from this data provides the “intelligence” that is indispensable for day-to-day operations, and research.  The Generative, Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) project is an autoregressive language model created by OpenAI in 2020. It trains machine learning to produce human readable text. GPT can produce writing that is indistinguishable from our own. In order to accomplish this, it uses up to 175 billion machine learning parameters and was trained on hundreds of billions of words. This is an incredible advancement in AI has benefits such as coding in languages like CSS, JSX and Python; writing poetry and prose; and creating newspaper articles.   Medical Informatics research using natural language processing (NPR) is targeting “polygenic risk scores” where you can use all the genetic variations in an individual to get a pretty good estimate of their long-term risk for a disease.  On the hardware side, in November of 2019 Cerebras (Cerebras.net) introduced the world’s fastest deep learning compute system. This is based on their Wafer-Scale-Engine, WSE, that is the largest commercial chip ever built to do deep-learning. This chip has 400,000 cores with 100 PB/s bandwidth; and 18 GB of on chip memory with 9 PB/s memory bandwidth.  In a word, these advances are astounding, and hardware is the key enabler. Yet we cannot ignore the ever present, dark web where its miscreants use malware to relentlessly attack and profit in billions of dollars annually. These malware attacks can generate gigabytes of data per second on the Internet, as well as Wide-Area and Local-Area-Networks. Currently, the use of state-of-the-art Big Data Analytic methods can detect attacks in real time data streams, log files, etc. Given this analysis practitioners are able to quarantine malware attacks, as well as build appropriate defenses.  Similarly, GPT-3 poses serious ethical risks. The long list of threats includes SPAM, misinformation, phishing, and writing original academic papers. The authors of this software are calling for research to mitigate such problems.   Finally, there is the environmental impact caused by these systems electrical power requirements.  While providing solutions are challenges for Data Analytics professionals, as shown above, state-of-the-art Data Analytics research in both industry and universities has already produced significant advances to provide intelligent tools practitioners are now using to tackle the big data problem. Given these tools, new Internet companies are now providing unified, state-of-the-art, Data Analytic platforms and technologies, which may be run on Cloud services.  These latter unified systems are yielding results from analyzing both real time as well as static, structured and unstructured big data. Salient examples are the open source, Apache Spark, TensorFlow, and DeltaLake projects.  As a consequence, the results of these interdisciplinary combinations of disparate fields of research in both academia and industry have set the stage for the unlimited potential of state-of-the-art Data Analytics to solve some of the world’s most difficult problems. To this end, we are looking for contributions from both practitioners of, as well as researchers in both academia and industry in the state-of-the-art Data Analytic fields. These include but are not limited to the following: Artificial Intelligence:  Machine learning, Knowledge graphs, and Expert systems， Natural language understanding for unstructured text and voice， Natural language generation along with research to mitigate the associated ethical problems. Cyber Security: Real Time network traffic monitoring and analysis to detect, resolve, and stop active malware attacks， Log file analysis to discover intruders’ points of attack. Cloud Services: The power and utility of hosting Data Analytics engines along with clean energy generation goals. Data Science: Statistics, data analysis, database theory, and data mining Biomedical research, Computation: Hardware advances to enhance Data Analytics performance. Operations Research: Algorithms used in Data Analytics. Massive, user based, Internet-wide, distributed computing: SETI@home’s BOINC and Astropulse are examples. Cyber Trust: Distributed trust architectures to insure the privacy, integrity, authentication, accountability, immutability and transparence of data.   Marketing Plan: The Minitrack will be advertised to specific target groups relevant to its scope including both current and past colleagues in Computer Science, Data Science, Medical Informatics, Knowledge Systems, Operations Research, and Information Systems Departments, as well as laboratories with relevant research in both academia and industry. Similarly, we seek significant, recent results in the area of Data Analytics from practitioners in Industry, cyber security, biomedical Research, health and well-being, the Internet of Things, business management, and marketing that require the intelligence provided by big Data Analytics. Considering Data Analytics’ dependence on multiple technical disciplines, those in areas such as Artificial Intelligence and machine learning, database theory, cloud computing, distributed systems, data base theory, and data science are of primary importance.  The Minitrack co-chairs are involved in ongoing research projects and initiatives in Europe, the US and Asia. A suitable journal is being sought for organizing a special issue on the theme of the Minitrack based on extended versions of high quality papers submitted.  Minitrack-chairs: William J.

Description of Minitrack:     The objective of this mini-track is to increase the visibility of current research and emergent trends in  Cyber-Assurance theory, application, embedded security and machine-learning for the Internet of Things  (IoT), software-defined networks (SDN)/network function virtualization (NFV), Edge computing and Fog  computing  architectures  based  on  theoretical  aspects  and  studies  of  practical  applications.  Cyber- assurance is the justified confidence that networked systems are adequately secure to meet operational  needs, even in the presence of attacks, failures, accidents and unexpected events. Cyber-assurance means  that IoT systems, smart internet connected devices (ICD) and networks provide the opportunity of  automatically securing themselves against cyber-attacks. The difference is that the concept of cyber- assurance must provide embedded, secure microchips/processors in ICD devices and virtual networks that  can continue to operate correctly even when subjected to an attack.    IoT devices using SDN/NFV and Fog computing systems and networks should be able to resist the  various security cyber-attacks such as hacking of networks, devices, theft of information, disruption, etc.  and  be  able  to  continue  performing  under  severe  environmental  conditions.  Through  embedded  processors and machine learning algorithms over the transmitted information, the miscoding and leaking  of information during transmission channels has to monitor any loss, miscoding and leaking of data.  Timely adjustments of information with falling quality and automatic switching to the best routing IoT  systems by making uses of multi-directional routing is also warranted. Cyber-assurance will need to  provide the principles and technologies to unify these systems to deliver the end-state goal of secure IoT  systems for greatly enhanced interoperability, scalability, performance, and agility.    The target audience of this mini-track will be composed of researchers, professionals and students  working  in  the  field  of  cyber-security,  wireless  technologies,  information  system  theory,  systems  engineering, information security architecture and security system design along with university professors  and  researchers  involved  in  information  assurance, cyber-security,  IoT,  SDN/NFV,  Edge, and  Fog  computing  related  networking.  Through  the  research  identified  for  this  track,  graduate  students,  researchers and academics who want to improve contribute their understanding of the latest security  developments for the IoT, SDN/NFV and Fog computing. This minitrack will focus on the security needs  of these environments, highlighting key issues and identifying the associated security implications so that  the general participates can readily grasp the core ideas in this area of research. Recommended topics for  this track include, but are not limited to, the following:    •  Hacking against IoT/Fog computing networks/devices  •  SDN/NFV/Edge/Fog security architectures and designs  •  Vulnerabilities and exploits in SDN/NFV/Edge/Fog architectures  •  Automated IoT/Fog computing vulnerability identification,   •  Research on automated IoT/Fog computing vulnerability assessment and intrusion detection tools  and techniques  •  Genetic algorithms used to spawn and control intelligent agents for information assurance for  IoT/Edge/Fog computing devices  •  Network management and visualization tools that support real time planning and control of  tactical nets as well as tools for intrusion detection and forensic analysis in hybrid IoT/Edge/Fog  computing networks   The Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences – 55 (HICSS-55)  Hyatt Regency, Maui  January 4-7, 2022  •  IoT/Edge/Fog Computing frameworks which allow diverse input data streams to be transformed  into a unified information fusion space for processing using more unified and tractable  procedures  •  Development of secure design methods, architectures, and implementations to minimize  IoT/Edge/Fog computing power dissipation  •  IoT/Edge/Fog Computing sensor networking systems, including signal processing and  communications interactions, distributed detection and estimation, and networking protocols,  •  High frequency IoT/Edge/Fog Computing devices and modules to enhance situational analysis  and increase the communication functionality     Organization Statements:  The U.S. Department of Defense and Syracuse University encourage and support involvement in the  HICSS-55 conference and will provide funding for travel and registration cost to attend the conference.

Especially the human factor of  information systems is a pivotal role in information security and increasingly relevant in  establishing user-privacy concepts. More often than not, their knowledge about security  aspects and ways of user-manipulation tactics are the last line of defense against cyber- attacks. However, studies show users are also seen as the weakest link in information security.  Therefore, they are also the primary target of attackers.   In addition to the traditional forms of user-computer-interactions in the form of mouse- keyboard-input-devices,  new  ways  of  system-interactions,  e.g.,  physiological  data  from  fitness-trackers, eye-tracking devices or even pupillary responses indicating cognitive-load- levels, are increasingly feasible as everyday HCI-components. With the interest in data privacy  increasing, are users aware how valuable those personal input data is and how do they value  data privacy measures?  Therefore, we have identified two main aspects relevant to researchers within the domain of  Software Technology: 1) how to securely deal with input data (also focusing on privacy  aspects) 2) how this data can be utilized in order to increase secure behavior or to raise  awareness among users (help the users to make better security-related decisions)    In this minitrack we seek papers that explore concepts, prototypes and evaluations of how  users interact with information systems and what implications these interactions have for  information security and privacy. Further, we welcome new and innovative ways of human- computer-interaction and security-related concepts currently examined in the field. Topics of  interest include but are not limited to:  •  Security related devices  •  Physiological sensors  •  Human-Computer-Interaction  •  Artificial intelligence  •  Blockchain applications  •  Sensor analysis  •  Data visualization  •  Biometrics authentication  •  Security and privacy awareness  •  Usable security design  •  Privacy and security by design  •  Privacy and smart contracts  •  User valuation of privacy  •  Validation of user data    Marketing plan:  We will announce the minitrack via  -  Research networks and social media (e.g., ResearchGate)  -  International mailing lists (IEEE Vis Mailing List, Eurographics Mailing List)  -  German mailing lists, such as German Society for Computer Science (Gesellschaft für  Informatik e.

However,  what we are interested in, in the context of this mini-track, is how the concepts and ideas of  Smart Applications are realized, especially from a software engineering point of view. Thus, we  are looking for manuscripts on planned, currently developed, and/or already finished Smart  Application, IoT and Industry 4.0 projects, feasibility studies of all domains, and evaluations of  such applications in the real world. We want to see which architectures, frameworks, platforms  and infrastructures seem to be particularly successful.     The user community for smart applications is characterized by different stakeholders: from  researchers to policy makers to the general public. Thus, it is crucial to achieve easy-to-use  end-to-end solutions, which support the diverse roles in these communities and their different  interests and knowledge about smart applications. Such concepts are considered in so-called  science gateways (also known as virtual laboratories or virtual research environments), which  by definition serve communities with end-to-end solutions tailored specifically to their needs.     Software challenges for smart applications are broad, not only in regard to the breadth of the  community, but also to the breadth of topics. A specific focus of this mini-track is on how to deal  with the details of scenarios like handling huge data sets, high usage loads, complex event  processing on real-time data streams, sharing data between applications, security and so forth.  We also look for disruptive technologies, which influence Smart (City) Applications  development, e.g. 5G networks, Spatial Computing, Blockchain, Conversational Computing and  Autonomous Vehicles.    Consequently, we anticipate submissions not limited to but in the scope of the following topics:  ●  System Architectures for Smart Application and Industry 4.0  ●  Best practices and Key Success Factors in Smart Application Development  ●  Platforms for Smart Applications  ●  Smart Applications for Smarter Government  ●  Data-hubs and their roles in Smart Application Developments  ●  Easy-to-use end-to-end solutions for Smart Applications  ●  Web services for Smart Applications  ●  Real-time data analytics and machine learning in practice  ●  Successful Smart Application Project Management  ●  Infrastructures for Smart Applications  ●  Securing Smart Applications and Sensor Networks  ●  Promoting Smart Applications  ●  Digital Twin technology for Smart Cities    Marketing Plan:  If the minitrack gets accepted, we plan to invite international PC members from USA, Europe,  Asia, Australia and New Zealand to reach a wide intercontinental community. We intend to  distribute the CFP via our current projects and centers such as the Science Gateways  Community Institute, Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation and Discovery Partner Institute in  the US as well as Future Internet Forum and Mission Board on Climate Neutral and Smart Cities  in Europe. We have an outreach covering all cyber infrastructure communities (including over  50 European projects) as well as partnerships such as Big Data Value Association, European  Network of Living Labs and Digital Innovation Hubs.

New or improved versions of existing frameworks, methods and  tools, plan-driven (e.g. waterfall) and change-driven (e.g. agile), are launched continuously. Vari- ous combinations of the two approaches have also been advocated and used. Despite of this,  the success rate of IS and SW development projects has remained at the modest 35-40 % level  with a slight 10-15 % increase in the success rate from the 25-30 % level of mid 1980s. Moreo- ver, a significant amount of IS and SW development projects are carried out without proper use  of any IS/SW development framework, method and tools.     The purpose of IS development is not only to design and implement software. Sometimes IS and  SW are developed in a process, a function or a product context. The context may also be the en- ablement and support of enterprise-wide digital transformations or even cross-enterprise digital  platforms . Thus, IS and SW development needs to be integrated with business process develop- ment, re-engineering or digitalization/digitization of existing processes; development of new  digital products, services or businesses; digitization of existing products, services and busi- nesses; or the development of other types software-enabled incremental and revolutionary in- novations. In the resulting activities and projects, it is often necessary to align different kinds of  competences, frameworks, methods, tools and even mindsets in order to control and synchro- nize work done in various subprojects or activities. The modest success rates of IS and other de- velopment projects encourage both the academic community and practitioners to search for  better answers to the needs of software and business engineering.    In this mini-track, we seek research papers and experience reports that explore how plan- driven, change-driven or hybrid frameworks, methods and tools are selected, integrated and de- ployed to align, synchronize and/or control software development, information systems devel- opment, business development, business process development, project and programme man- agement, and innovation management in the various digitalization and development contexts of   businesses, their processes, products and services. The main emphasis of the mini-track is to im- prove understanding and design of the conceptual and methodological linkages between soft- ware engineering and business engineering. Plan-driven, change-driven and hybrid frameworks,  methods and tools are used in both “worlds”, and for that reason various combinations are pos- sible, and many incoherencies and different kind of organizational tensions may occur. In addi- tion to academics, we strongly encourage practitioners to submit their insights and experiences.     Software and business development activities / projects vary in sizes, complexity, number of in- cluded persons / actors and other characteristics such as dynamics, novelty, capabilities, or im- portance. A software could be developed internally, co-sourced or outsourced. In addition to  that, the participation of business professionals, software users, internal IT professionals and ex- ternal IT professionals may change during the lifecycle of software and business development  from requirements engineering to IS roll-outs and the post-evaluation of an IS. An IS user organi- zation may not be able to assess the possibilities and limitations of various software develop- ment methods. An IS developer organization or an IS service provider company may ponder how  the characteristics of business innovation / engineering and its methods influence software de- velopment. Given this variety, do we need to apply and align software, business process and  other development frameworks, methods and tools case specific – or is it possible to offer more  generic recommendations on how to apply them in alignment? How to best link the knowledge  bases and capabilities of business development professionals, IS users and IS developers? Re- search may focus on the requirements engineering, design, development, testing, implementa- tion, usage, roll-out and/or evaluation of software development in business development  and/or innovation development contexts.

Majchrzak, University of Agder, Tor-Morten Grønli, Kristiania University College, and  Hermann Kaindl, TU Wien  Minitrack Description  Applications for mobile devices (apps) have facilitated the success of smartphones and tablets. By us- ing apps, the multi-purpose hardware of modern devices can be utilized to the full extent. Despite  much progress in development methods, software development kits, and frameworks, app develop- ment poses many challenges. This is even more so for novel mobile devices such as wearables and for  the hardware that constitutes the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Compat- ibility, performance, battery-saving, and security and safety are only some of the issues that are mainly  driven by the quality of the used software. A satisfying level of this quality in many cases is very hard  to achieve and proper techniques for testing and formal verification are needed.  Experiences and methods from classical software development can only be utilized to some degree.  Moreover, the inherent challenges of the respective new devices ask for novel solutions. The chal- lenges sketched above are reinforced by the conditions that development activities meet. Typical par- ticularities include the need for multi-platform development, device fragmentation, context-sensitiv- ity, low computational power, little memory, energy conservation requirements, and the heterogene- ity of users. With the emergence of multi-platform and multi-device, the new golden standard are  applications not only across software ecosystems, but across hardware platforms such as laptop, mo- bile, tablets, embedded devices, sensors and wearables. Therefore, new threads of research are  needed to tackle these issues and to pave the way for improved software development, better busi- ness producibility and improved user experience (UX).  This minitrack started as Mobile App Development (HICSS-49 and HICSS-50) before broadening to Soft- ware Development for Mobile Devices, Wearables, and the Internet-of-Things (HICSS-51 and HICSS-52).  In its fifth and sixth year (HICSS-53 and HICSS-54), we adapted it to the continuously changing land- scape to keep it attractive to the community. Our minitrack invites researchers from software engi- neering, human-computer interaction, information systems, computer science, electrical engineering,  and any other discipline that contributes to the topics covered by our minitrack.  The minitrack is devoted to the technological background of mobile computing while keeping an eye  on business value, user experience, and domain-specific issues. Contributions may take a sociotech- nical view or report on technological progress. Topics of interests include the full spectrum of research  on mobile devices, IoT, and CPS, for example (but not limited to)  •  Case studies of development   •  Development methods and specification techniques  •  Economic and social impact  •  Software engineering education  •  User interface (UI) design and user experience (UX) research  •  Testing, simulation, and formal verification  •  Hybrid and cross-platform development, Progressive Web Apps (PWA)  •  Web technology  •  Security, safety, and privacy  •  Legal aspects of software  •  Energy-efficient computing  •  Sensor-usage  •  The convergence between mobile devices, IoT, and CPS  •  Fog, edge, and dew computing and their computational applications  Minitrack Role for HICSS  Several minitracks at HICSS feature topics that deal with mobility. However, mobility as an overall topic  of prevalent importance for the anticipated digital transformation of society is still underrepresented.  Moreover, with the broadened scope the minitrack is less risky to be “cannibalized” by domain-specific  minitracks on mobility and will itself hardly “cannibalize” other minitracks. The minitrack will provide  an outlet for mobile computing and IoT- as well as CPS-related papers that do not specifically fit with  other minitracks, and it will continue to offer a meeting place for software engineers at HICSS.   Minitrack Marketing  The minitrack will be advertised in several ways.  Firstly, along with the general activities for HICSS, a Call for Papers (CfP) will be disseminated trough  the usual information systems research mailing lists such as AISWorld. Moreover, dissemination to  computer science mailing lists such as SEWORLD, DBWorld and EAPLS will be sought.  Secondly, indirect dissemination through the community will be stimulated. This will be mainly driven  through our board of reviewers, who work on the communities of mobile computing and related fields  and thereby can directly communicate the CfP to colleagues.  Thirdly, the chairs will solicit papers from their own network in research and industry.  Fourthly, a mailing list for attendants and supporters of the minitracks at HICSS-49 through HICSS-54  has been set-up. It will be used to further spread the work.  Follow-up Publication  We offered a LNBIP post-publication for the HICSS-52 edition of the minitrack. For HICSS-53 and  HICSS-54 we fast-track selected papers to be published as extended versions in the International  Journal of Pervasive Computing and Communications (IJPCC). We intend the same for HICSS-55.  2 / 3  Chairs and Program Committee  Minitrack Chair (Primary Contact):  Minitrack Co-Chairs:    Tim A.

These networks  include cellular networks (6G, 5G, 4G, 3G, and 2G), Wi-Fi networks, sensor networks, ad-hoc networks, Bluetooth, and more.  The breadth of this minitrack includes technical, social,  environmental and other issues. Technical issues are found in the protocol stack from the physical layer to the application  layer, including security, efficiency, scalability, the design and motivation of new systems,  novel applications, better use of existing technology, energy efficiency of communications,  regulatory issues, and in general, issues that are of concern when designing or building  cellular and wireless networks.  Often, technical solutions must be accompanied by relevant  social, environmental, or economic considerations which may be essential to the success of  the technology, so appropriate non-technical papers are also welcome in this minitrack. Description of technical area Cellular and Wireless Networks The research area of cellular and wireless networks spans diverse technologies and  applications including mobile broadband networks, wireless data networks, wireless sensor  networks, and wireless network security.  It includes technologies, such as LTE, NR, 6G, IoT,  WiFi, and Zigbee, and ranges from deployments on a national scale to small experimental  networks.  Papers in this field provide innovative solutions to challenges, whether new or well  established, where the most interesting portion of the network is wireless.  Such issues and  solutions will primarily be technical, but relevant social, environmental, or economic issues  are also appropriate for this minitrack. The defining property of cellular and wireless networks is the use of the wireless medium, with all its challenges and opportunities, to support communication, often among mobile systems.   Issues for such systems are as diverse as security, spectrum and channel allocation, cell  sizes and offloading, all the way to game-theoretic incentive designs and routing protocols.   Another defining property of cellular and wireless networks is their ubiquity, and this minitrack  welcomes any contribution that offers new insights into recent and emerging standards, such  as 5G and 6G, or into existing widely deployed networks. Support for mobility may range from cellular handoff to vehicle-to-roadside VANET applications and ad-hoc wireless networks.   Novel applications of wireless networks are also appropriate, especially if these applications  are enabled by recent advances in the technology.  Non-technical issues that may affect the  success or usefulness of a new technology, or issues of scale and experimentation and  evaluation of existing, practical networks are all relevant to this topic. Topical coverage The following is a partial list of research topics of interest for this minitrack:  6G, 5G, 4G, 3G, and 2G cellular networks  Wi-Fi networks  ad hoc wireless networks including mesh networks  wireless communication for the Internet of Things (IoT) and VANETs   wireless communication for home automation   security in wireless networks   protocols and algorithms for physical, MAC, routing, transport, and application layers,  including  cross-layer techniques  theoretical issues of interest in the design or implementation of wireless networks,  including communications, scalability, coordination, access control, and other  advances in the field, such as millimeter wave technologies  novel applications of wireless networks  social and environmental benefits and consequences of the use of wireless networks  and new applications. In general, this minitrack is expansive in welcoming submissions in any area related to  cellular and wireless networks including visible light communication.  Prospective authors are  encouraged to contact the minitrack chairs if they seek more detailed guidance. Marketing Plan Our marketing plan for this minitrack is multifaceted. As active researchers in the cellular and  wireless networking field, we attend other conferences throughout the year where we will  distribute fliers and make announcements about the minitrack.  In addition, we plan to contact past participants of the HICSS Wireless Networks minitrack.  We have been talking one-on- one with our colleagues to encourage them to submit papers, and will continue to do so.  We  will place an announcement on WikiCFP. Finally, since two of us are U.S. Government  employees, we have access to large internal U.S. Government networks where we plan to  release announcements and post details of the minitrack. A distributable and printable call for papers (CFP) is included as the last page in this  document. Suitability for HICSS This minitrack proposal builds on several years of prior success for the minitrack on wireless  networks, the minitrack on wireless sensor networks and the minitrack on wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks. Several prominent conferences exist that delve deeply into the technical foundations of  wireless networks, cellular networks, or both.  These include the IEEE Wireless and  Computer Networking Conference (WCNC) and the ACM International Conference on Mobile  Computing and Networking (MobiCom). These vertical conferences are primarily targeted at  computer scientists and electrical engineers and do not tend to consider the cross-section of  systems engineers and information scientists interested in the application and social impact of wireless networking technology. A minitrack on cellular and wireless networks is highly complementary to HICCS. The  systemic effect of cellular and wireless networking is already inherently discussed in sessions  throughout the conference. This minitrack allows those researchers exposure to future  directions in wireless networking technology that may impact the systems they are focused  on.
