According to PwC, 72% of business executives say that AI will give them a  competitive advantage in the future1. In fact, in many ways the future is already here. Several  repetitive  and  simple  tasks  that  were  typically  performed  by  humans  are  now  being  automated by AI bundled with other technologies, such as cloud systems, augmented reality,  (social) robots, IoTs, and wearables. Consequently, the ratio of tasks executed by machines to  humans is dramatically shifting. Human workers are rapidly being replaced with AI on many  fronts. For instance, in 2018 an average of 71% of total task hours were performed by humans  compared to 29% accomplished by machines. However, this average is expected to shift  dramatically in the near future with 58% of tasks hours expected to be performed by humans  and the remaining 42% to be handled exclusively by machines by 20222.     In a world of such rapid technological changes, it is paramount to have an overview of the  research being conducted in this discipline. Such an understanding of current developments  of AI and associated technologies enables us to envision the future workplace and its effect  on  human  employees.  These  insights  also  provide  guidance  to  employees,  teams,  organizations, and governments in creating a sustainable and synergistic workplace. Finally,  engaging in this research allows us to proactively counter any negative effects that may arise  from the changes in the work settings. Through this minitrack, we hope to create a platform  where researchers working on AI in the context of future of work can come together and  create collaborations that will allow them to capitalize on each other’s work.    SHORT MINI-TRACK DESCRIPTION   This minitrack focuses on the impact of AI on the various aspects of the workplace as it exists  currently as well as how it may evolve in the future. We seek papers that address the social,  technical, behavioral, attitudinal, emotional, or managerial aspects of AI in the workplace. The  unit of analysis can be individuals, teams, or organizations. All kinds of research are welcome  including but not limited to quantitative, qualitative, conceptual, or design-oriented research.    1 Bothun, D., Liebermann, M., and Rao, A.

In short, this minitrack seeks to highlight  research that may influence the future of work and act as a springboard for new ideas and  innovations in AI that will be disruptive to the workplace. The first minitrack at HICSS-54 was  highly successful and attracted several submissions despite the pandemic. The online session  held was also very successful with approximately 38 attendees at its peak.    The “AI and the Future of Work” minitrack is especially interested in the following topics:  1.  Power shifts between humans and AI   2.  AI and employees’ mental and physical wellbeing   3.  Shift in social/role identities with the introduction of AI   4.  Required skill set for human employees in an era of AI  5.  AI and the changing face of leadership   6.  Social relationships and AI at the workplace  7.  Integration of AI and work practices (knowledge sharing, decision making,  etc.)  8.  Ethical considerations of AI at the workplace   9.  Financial and economic implications of AI implementation in the workplace  10. The changing meaning of work or work-life balance in an era of AI   11. AI task appropriateness   12. Designing AI for the workplace   13. AI and changes in work settings   14. Workplace Analytics and AI  15. AI and creativity in the workplace    ORGANIZATION SUPPORT  University of South Florida (USF), Renmin University of China, and LUT University endorse the  minitrack chairs both in terms of infrastructure and finances to organize this minitrack.    MARKETING   The minitrack will be promoted on social media platforms such as LinkedIn (e.g., dedicated  groups like “Machines as Teammates”), Twitter and Facebook as many academics are active  on these platforms. In addition, we will be reaching out to a list of individuals who attended  the  minitracks  “Machines  as  Teammates”,  “Social  &  Psychological  Perspectives  in  Collaboration Research”, and “Creativity: Research & Practice” in previous years. The call for  papers will be sent to the AIS email list server to reach the community of IS scholars. Further,  we will distribute the call for papers and promote the minitrack at conferences, workshops  and seminars that we will attend.         2      BIOGRAPHICAL STATEMENTS  Triparna de Vreede is faculty at the Muma College of Business at the University of South  Florida.

Much of this diverse data in unstructured and structured forms has a high business value and, if properly utilized, can become an important organizational asset. It contains various information about customers, competition, labor market, and development trends for industries, products and services, as well as the public and political mood. For innovative, collaborative and sustainable development, it is essential for organizations to utilize this data to increase sales, identify future opportunities and new markets, outperform the competition, enhance products and services, recruit talent, improve operations, perform forecasting, protect the brand, and identify areas for improvement to name a few. However, many organizations make a limited use of this valuable data available to them either because they lack necessary tools or do not understand the value of this data. The main objective of this minitrack is to provide organizations a theoretical, conceptual, and applied grounded discussion of Business Intelligence (BI) to aid in innovative, collaborative, and sustainable development as well as effective decision-making. This minitrack addresses the following topics:  What is the substance (nature) of BI? What is the added-value of BI to development of organizations and their decision-making process? How to support organizational creativity, innovation, collaboration and decision-making using BI? How to design intelligent information systems and build decision support systems based on BI? How to enhance company level decision making process to integrate external stakeholders in order to develop collaborations? How to use BI tools and solutions to achieve innovative, collaborative and sustainable development of organizations in digital era?  Thus, the Business Intelligence for Innovative, Collaborative and Sustainable Development of Organizations minitrack invites papers focused on, but not limited to: Theoretical foundations for BI development BI to improve innovative, collaborative and sustainable development of organizations Challenges and opportunities of applying BI for innovative, collaborative and sustainable development of organizations Development of BI and big data analytics capability BI driven strategies BI-enabled business transformation Business value of BI BI engineering for business model innovation Practical approaches, solutions, methods, and tools to foster innovative, collaborative, and sustainable development of organizations by using of BI  Cognitive technologies in organizations Social networks The evolution of BI through wide diffusion of digital technologies and digital platforms The discussion undertaken under this minitrack will accelerate the convergence process of various disciplines such as strategic management, computer science, database and data warehouse technologies, computational intelligence and soft computing, psychology, and social sciences. It seeks to revitalize scientific discussion and to establish closer cooperation with international research centers dealing with BI use in organizations. This minitrack will discuss how to improve innovative and collaborative development as well as decision-making in organizations by using BI, and ultimately the functioning of the entire socio-economic system. Journals for fast track opportunities Information Systems Management (in progress) In 2020 and 2021 Dr. Olszak, Dr. Zurada and Dr. Cetindamar were guest editors of the special issues of the Information Systems Management (ISM) journal. This special issue was already published in Fall 2021 and contains 6 papers which represent an enhanced and extended version of papers presented in our mini-track and other similar minitracks at HICS-53.

We need new forms of digital collaboration tools, new ways to collaborate, and new core values and methods of collaboration – which triggers the quest to redesign collaboration tools and methods. Information Systems and Information Technology have for a long time played a major role in supporting sustainability goals and a substantial research strand on “green IS/IT” has existed for many years. However, motivated by observing positive side effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as positive ecolocical effects through less travel and more virtualized collaboration, we believe that there are many more and not yet understood effects IT and IS can have on ecological and social sustainability goals, particularly through the virtualization of communication and collaboration. While there are obvious advantages, there are also downsides and challenges which require research activities to detect, understand, and mitigate those. Integration of people, processes, and information systems across organizational and national borders enables productive teamwork towards achieving mutual goals. People involved should be motivated to enter into collaborative projects and interactions, which lead to satisfaction and performance. Perception of value, trust, and commitment among participants and stakeholders fosters quality in collaboration. With progress in globalization and AI technology, many of these collaborations are increasing across widely dispersed organizations and national borders. Cross-system integration and intelligent collaboration technologies play crucial roles and often decide about IS project success or failure. Additional complexity and dynamics evolve through digital innovation activities in which collaborators, across organizations, countries, and cultures, work on new digital products, services, and business models – changing the way to shape innovation success. Digital collaboration has been increasing by organizations seeking to gain competitive advantage by lowering costs, increasing knowledge, and reaching new customers. Perceived value serves as a stimulus for further growth.  Possible contributions regarding the cross-organizational and cross-border collaboration may include, but are not limited to the following: Processes of international and inter-organizational collaboration in IS/IT projects and operations Effects of collaboration on IS/IT performance Conceptual frameworks of IS/IT collaboration across organizations and borders Motivating factors for IS/IT collaboration External pressures and environmental factors influencing IS/IT collaboration Methodologies for studies of IS/IT collaboration Development and validation of IS/IT collaboration instrument  IS/IT collaboration studies at country, industry, firm, project, team or individual level  Challenges of managing cross-organizational/cross-cultural agile teams Comparative cross-country research on IT/IS collaboration Industry-specific and organization-specific case studies on IT/IS collaboration Managing IS/IT outsourcing and offshoring/nearshoring relationships Out-tasking and crowdsourcing in IT/IS contexts Valuing investments in IS/IT collaboration Cross-organizational and international IS/IT project management  Multinational teams and their cultural and leadership factors IT/IS-enabled Open Innovation approaches Cross-organizational innovation approaches and processes AI applications on collaboration of global virtual teams Collaboration cases on Big-Data analytics for creating customer value Social collaboration using online social networks across countries Sustainability enabled and facilitated through digital collaboration The role of digital collaboration for impact sourcing and other forms of sustainability-focused outsourcing engagements SME case studies on social innovations and sustainability  Proposed Minitrack Chairs (PRIMARY Contact Person) Ilsang Ko (Chonnam National University) Room BUS 2-221 77 Yongbong-Ro, Buk-Gu Gwangju, South Korea +82-10-9603-2711    Daniel Beimborn (University of Bamberg) An der Weberei 5 96045 Bamberg, Germany daniel.beimborn@uni-bamberg.de  We believe that the mini-track, which has been successful during the HICSS 2006 through HICSS 2022 meetings, will provide a forum for researchers interested in this topic and can make the HICSS conference the preferred meeting point for this kind of research.  JOURNAL AND CONFERENCE COVERAGE ON THE TOPIC OF IS/IT COLLABORATION AND ITS PAYOFFS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY  We Guest-edit a Special Issue of Sustainability; 2022  We Guest-edited a Special Issue of European Journal of Information Systems; Volume 19(2) April 2010.  We Guest-edited a special issue of Electronic Markets, 22(1) March 2012.  Regarding the topic of Cross Organizational and Cross Border IS/IT Collaboration, several journals publish articles related to this topic, including: International Journal of Project Management Information and Management MIS Quarterly European Journal of Information Systems Journal of Management Information Systems  Information Systems Research Information Systems Journal Journal of AIS Communications of ACM Communications of AIS International Journal of Information Management  The topic of Cross Organizational and Cross Border IS/IT collaboration is also covered by conferences such as ICIS, AMCIS, PACIS, and INFORMS  Several journals focus particularly on the global aspects of IS/IT. They include: Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries Journal of Global Information Technology Management Journal of Global Information Management  In summary, in leading journals and conferences, the topics in our mini-track proposal are current and growing. Yet those papers usually only partially address the track’s research issues. There is a need for a consistent quality publication and presentation outlet for research on IS/IT collaboration and its payoffs in the global economy.  4.  MARKETING OF THE MINI-TRACK  This mini-track will seek broad set of perspectives and research frameworks and encourages innovative ideas. For this mini-track a pool of authors has been developed who are motivated and interested in it. We will encourage these established authors and others to be involved in this track which is celebrating the tenth anniversary. We now have experienced a good number of submissions to the mini-track from year to year. We will encourage authors to send their abstract to mini-track chairs ahead of time if they would like feedback on your proposal for a paper.   Many of the papers from prior HICSS mini-tracks in this series have been published in journal special issues edited by the mini-track co-chairs, which has given this mini-track visibility and access to a larger group of authors as well as reviewers. Further motivation is our continuous effort for special issues. We have a large database of reviewers and potential authors. For HICSS-56 2023 we plan to try to grow the size of the community involved in the mini-track by: Inviting the authors who previously submitted to our HICSS 2006 through HICSS 2022 mini-tracks, Sustainability special issue, JITTA special issue, two International Journal of e-Collaboration (IJEC) special issues, and Electronic Markets (EM) special issue to submit papers Encouraging the reviewers, who reviewed the papers for our HICSS mini-tracks, JITTA special issue, two IJEC special issues, EJIS and EM special issues, to submit their own papers Inviting a larger number of colleagues working in the field to submit papers Sending the call for papers to the ISWorld and ACM SIGMIS mailing lists   BIOGRAPHIES OF CO-CHAIRS  Ilsang Ko is Dean and Professor of Management Information System, Graduate School of Business, Chonnam National University.

While the minitrack, which began with a focus on Global Virtual Teams, has had ebbs and flows, it continues to attract many high-quality papers that illuminate a wide range of research related to virtual teams, organizations, and networks. We have regularly had upwards of 35 participants in the minitrack. In addition to the minitrack, for four years we organized a very successful linked workshop on Cross-Cultural Collaboration in Global Virtual Teams. In 2013 at HICSS-46, the workshop included an innovative keynote presentation from one of our current Minitrack Co-Chairs, Alberto Espinosa, on his book, I’m Working While They’re Sleeping: Time Zone Separation Challenges and Solutions. In 2015 at HICSS-48 we introduced the tutorial on big data analytics and text mining in global virtual teams research, which has also continued through HICSS 55 as a minitrack and tutorial on Text Analytics. While geographically distributed collaboration has been the subject of academic research for decades, the entire world coping with the global COVID-19 pandemic and its variants has accelerated interest in this critically important area of research and practice. Over the past two years, many organizations and networks have experienced a substantial increase in the depth and breadth of remote work, and hybrid and technology-mediated collaboration. The pandemic has substantially altered organizational practices of employees, contractors, and network members who collaborate across multiple spatial, temporal, and digital boundaries in complex configurations. These distributed collaborations are often comprised of multi-team systems, complex dependency relationships, and organizational boundaries. Coordinating task work and teamwork over a web of communication, information sharing, and knowledge relationships continues to serve as an important locus for research opportunities. In addition, the pandemic has altered and intensified practices of telework, remote education, online shopping, virtual conferences, distributed social events, and many other unique adaptations to this historic period, including future predictions of an increasing amount of hybrid work – which combines remote and onsite work, with different blends of synchronous and asynchronous work. The implications are profound from every perspective – including, economic, environmental, social, efficiencies. Contemporary collaborative work can rarely be studied from the perspective of single teams because work units are often comingled into larger organizational networks embedded in multi-team internal and external systems, operating in multiple locations across diverse functions. Moreover, these complex configurations change and evolve to adapt to new unfamiliar situations. Most business, government and scientific projects and processes today also have a very prominent virtual dimension. Virtual collaborators often do not have the same first language, come from different national cultures, work in different time zones, and may be employed by different organizations, and enter collaborations with different expectations for group processes. Collaborators often come and go from one project to the next and from one team to another. These differences and multiplex view of collaboration networks present unique opportunities for management and leadership.  Research on virtual teams, distributed collaboration, telework, hybrid work, organizations and networks of relationships is necessarily multi-disciplinary to address the key challenges collaborators face, while accounting for the complex context in which such collaborations occur.  Thus, we encourage submissions that may inform practice and research in distributed collaboration and telework through a variety of academic lenses and research that highlight methodological issues and innovation in the study of virtual teams, organizations, and networks. This minitrack invites papers that offer direct and indirect insights into the operation of virtual teams, distributed collaboration, telework and hybrid work, organizations, and networks, including research in the vein of computer supported collaborative work (CSCW), computer supported collaborative learning (CSCW), human computer interaction (HCI), and social, organizational and knowledge networks. The topics for this minitrack include but are not limited to:  Spatial and temporal separation and its effects on collaboration Coordination in collaboration across multiple boundaries Coordination and dependency networks Team knowledge networks quantitative and visual analysis Impacts and consequences of telework and hybrid work on organizational and network outcomes Team dynamics and distributed leadership in hybrid work Cultural differences in perception of time Conflict management across cultures Project management styles and differences across cultures Differences in language understanding and its effects on collaboration Power distance and its effects on collaboration Uncertainty (risk) avoidance and its effects on collaboration Anonymity in multicultural teams eLeadership and trust Deception in virtual teams Multi-team systems Social loafing in virtual teams Personality and its role in telework or virtual teams Cross-cultural training Virtual team collaboration and innovation Emotion in virtual teams Relationship building in virtual teams Information sharing in virtual teams Collaboration and communication processes and tools Differences between academic and non-academic virtual teams Social Network Theory and Analysis Identifying multi-level influences on virtual teams, organizations, and networks Scientific collaboration in virtual teams (Team Science) Methodological advances on network science and graph analytics Minitrack Relevance This minitrack is expected to draw significant attention from academics and practitioners because of its relevance to management of global, remote and hybrid collaboration and teamwork. These topics have been included routinely in minitrack sessions at major conferences in the past few years including HICSS, ICIS, AMCIS, CSCW, CHI, ICGSE, ICSE, RE, and DSI. In addition, numerous studies of global virtual teams and social/knowledge networks have been reported in publications such as the Journal of Computer Mediated Communication, Communications of the ACM, MIS Quarterly, Journal of Management Information Systems, Management Science, Organization Science and Journal of Computer Information Systems. There is also considerable interest in this topic elsewhere. A short list of recent publications in this area follows:   1. A recent publication entitled “Nationality Biases in Peer Evaluations: The Country-of-Origin Effect in Global Virtual Teams” (Tavoletti et al, 2022) highlighted the impact of nationality on peer evaluations in teams operating in a post-COVID-19 world.   2. Another recent publication entitled, “Transactional Memory Systems in Virtual Teams: Communication Antecedents and the Impact of TMS Components on Creative Processes and Outcomes” (Aissa, et al, 2022) also cited the importance of virtual teams research following the COVID-19 pandemic.    3. In a January 2022 publication entitled “Global Virtual Team Leadership Scales (GVTLS) Development in Multinational Companies”, Batirik, Gencer, and Akkuck that virtual teams have become indispensable for many industries.   4. Tyagi et al (2022) illustrate the importance of trust in their article entitled, “Empirically Developed Framework for Building Trust in Distributed Agile Teams”.    5. Finally, Adamovic (2022) explores the impact of culture and telework in “How Does Employee Cultural Background Influence the Effects of Telework on Job Stress? The Role of Power Distance, Individualism, and Believes about Telework”.  6. Minitrack co-chair, Derrick Cogburn, led a multi-institutional team funded by the National Science Foundation under the Virtual Organizations as Sociotechnical Systems (VOSS) program. Marketing plan Our strategy for this year will be like last year, which was very effective in increasing the volume of submissions substantially. We plan to market the minitrack as follows We will market the minitrack aggressively through the various academic and professional associations of the co-chairs. These associations include (AIS, Academy of Management, INGRoup, Science of Team Science, International Communication Section–ISA, Information Technology Section–APSA, Global Internet Governance Academic Network (GigaNet), and Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR)). The four of us have extensive networks of colleagues in the fields of CSCW, geographically distributed collaborative learning, management and information technology, both in the United States and globally. In addition, we will contact by email everyone that submitted, presented, or reviewed a paper for or attended the minitrack since 2009 and invite them to submit a paper this year. Encourage authors of this year's submissions to forward the email to potentially interested colleagues. Contact anyone who submitted a paper for another track which could as well have been submitted for our minitrack.  Contact personal acquaintances working in academia and elsewhere and ask them to submit a paper and to spread the word. Advertise through traditional academic channels such as ISWorld. Publish the call for papers by submitting it -- insofar as this is possible -- to the same lists as calls for papers for other, similar conferences such as ICGSE, RE, etc  Minitrack Chairs:  Derrick L.

The evolution of  digital collaboration technologies over the past decades has given rise to a new application domain of data  science. These emerging technologies range from collaboration software for business such as enterprise  collaboration systems and social networking tools, distributed ledger technology, and Internet of Things,  to public collaboration platforms such as social media crowdsourcing platforms, and open source  communities (e.g., GitHub). Businesses and organizations use these systems for collaboration on projects,  knowledge management, supply chain management, and customer relationship management. The public  can use them for collaboration, information sharing, community support, and social goods. Applying data  science in these domains allows for leveraging the newly available digital trace data for gaining  actionable knowledge and insights on how people collaborate and how these platforms facilitate digital  collaboration, which can lead to improvements in system design as well as collaboration processes  including problem solving and decision making. Moreover, collaboration technologies can facilitate  collaborative and distributed data science projects. Data science for digital collaboration is addressed  through a variety of perspectives. For instance, social analytics is used to generate structural insights into  topics, content and relationships that emerge through digital collaboration. Process mining is applied to  discover sequences and interaction patterns of digital collaboration processes.     Data science for digital collaboration comes with many challenges. Emerging applications of technologies  such as distributed ledgers and IoT create vast amounts of heterogeneous data at an accelerating rate,  which brings collaborative management and analysis of big data into focus. In particular, for decision  makers in businesses, advanced analytics methods tend to be incomprehensible, which heightens the need  for explainable data science and human-guided knowledge discovery. The application of data science in  the corporate context creates challenges regarding ethical and legal issues.  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  Social analytics in digital collaboration  Process mining in digital collaboration  Data science in blockchain and distributed ledger applications  Data science in Internet of Things   Data science in human-machine collaboration  Data science in digital collaboration on social goods  Collaborative analysis of big data   Collaborative collection and management of big data  Visualization of big data in digital collaboration  Crowdsourcing analytics  Security and privacy analytics in digital collaboration  Human-guided knowledge discovery   Humans in the loop data science  Ethical and legal issues in collaborative data science  Case studies on collaborative data science  Best practice for collaboration in data science    While the topic of data science has been covered by many conferences, to our knowledge, there is a  dearth of mini-tracks at HICSS that focus on data science in the context of digital collaboration. Based on  our review of recent industry trends, there is a lot of buzz around analytics and collaboration which is  lacking in academia. We propose to address this gap by offering a mini-track that will focus not only on  big data and analytics but also on the entire gamut of research topics on data science in digital  collaboration. The proposed mini-track has been part of the Collaboration Systems and Technologies  Track for seven years.  The co-chairs of the proposed mini-track have significant experience in organizing tracks and mini-tracks  in national and international conferences such as AMCIS, HICSS, and pre-ICIS workshops. Lina Zhou  served as a Program Chair of IEEE Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics and a Program  Vice Chair of IEEE/ACM Conference on Web Intelligence, among others. Souren Paul co-chaired ICIS  2020 and AMCIS 2015. He will co-chair ICIS 2023. He has co-chaired a mini-track on technology- mediated collaborations in healthcare at the Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences  (HICSS) since 2010. In addition, he has co-chaired mini-tracks on virtual teams at the Americas  Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS) for six years. He also co-chaired mini-tracks on cognition  and knowledge sharing in collaborative technology supported group work at HICSS in 2005 and 2007.  Florian Schwade has co-chaired the mini-track at HICSS since 2020 and serves as associate editor for the  Social Media & Digital Collaboration track at ECIS, ECIS and the German conference on  Wirtschaftsinformatik. Through those multiple experiences, the co-chairs have a wide reach to researchers  to seek good quantity of quality work to submit to this mini-track. In addition, the co-chairs will contact  journal editors to seek a special issue on this topic to even enhance quality submissions.  At the current time, each organization of the Mini-track Chairs endorses their involvements with HICSS  and at least one or more will pay for their respective mini-track co-chair’s travel and registration cost to  attend HICSS.   Marketing plan:    It is planned to advertise the mini-track via AIS World, mailing lists of regional IS and other related  research communities and personal networks of the co-chairs. The diversity of the mini-track co-chairs  allows for broad dissemination of the mini-track in the data science and IS research communities in  specific regions such as America, Pacific-Asia and Europe which are the hotspots for data science  research. Upon acceptance of the mini-track it is planned to disseminate a first announcement in March  with several reminders over the following months into the relevant research communities.

MINI-TRACK DESCRIPTION FOR PROGRAM ANNOUNCEMENT COVID-19 clearly demonstrated the importance and prevalence of collaboration technologies.  It radically changed the way we work and the frequency of use of various collaboration technologies. The pace of change looks only to accelerate as the metaverse and extended reality technology promise new possibilities for both in person and remote collaboration.  For over a decade, this mini track has examined the design, development, and evaluation of collaboration technologies.  The recent pandemic has demonstrated the impact of collaboration on organizational performance and has proven to be more critical than strategic orientation or market and technological turbulence.  Successful collaboration is often difficult. Groups and teams often need to overcome both physical and metaphorical distance. Other challenges include groupthink, dominance, lack of efficiency, lack of focus, overwhelming information, differing motivations, and uncertainty.   The challenge for researchers and practitioners alike is to design sustainable processes and systems within and between organizations that allow people, groups, teams and machines to collaborate successfully. This challenge has many dimensions that cross technical, behavioral, social, emotional, economic, and political boundaries. This mini-track invites papers that address the theory, design, development, deployment, and evaluation of collaboration processes and systems within and between organizations, groups, teams, and machines.

Students, businesses, politicians and everyone is looking for safe virtual solutions. In addition, emerging issues like big data, data analytics, visual analytics, data mining, crowd--sourcing, e-government, e-health and m-commerce are giving new meaning to distributed decision making. Coordination among individuals with varying skills distributed across is becoming common.  Gartner group predicts that Swarm teams will become norm in the future. Given the global nature of world economy, outsourcing is becoming a norm creating temporary or swarm teams. Companies are no longer providing long-term contracts but are renewing them based on deliverables from outsourced companies. This is putting tremendous pressure on teams to deliver quality product on time at a reasonable cost. Team adaptability and team configuration are becoming crucial to meet deadlines. Teams must be able to adapt quickly to the changing environment be it face-to-face, mobile or in the cloud. Agile teams adapt and deliver quickly and provide maximum customer satisfaction. By definition, however, agile teams must be co-located. Can distributed teams be agile and adaptable? This requires careful team configuration. This mini-track examines the emerging issues related to team configuration and performance in distributed environment.  Some research related to outsourcing of structured tasks has been done, but research related to emerging issues like diversity, cohesiveness, agility and adaptability related to group collaboration across semi or unstructured tasks is still emerging. In addition, cloud computing is making it feasible to provide computing services at a reasonable cost. As cloud computing diffuses, decision making either individually or in a group using resources on the clouds is not far behind. Cloud computing will provide tremendous opportunities to distributed groups to make any time any place decisions at a reasonable cost.  In addition, the “e (Internet)” to “m (mobile)”  to “c (cloud) transformation is creating exciting opportunities for groups to make real time decisions in a mobile  possibly in the cloud environment . Distributed teams, however, face many challenges of time, location, infrastructure, language, customs, socialization and politics. This is further compounded in globally distributed teams by diversity, nationality and cultural issues. As old issue are resolved, new challenges emerge that require knowledge from multiple disciplines such as information systems, social sciences, international management, leadership and political science. It is almost impossible for one individual to have expertise in so many domains, which makes this a very challenging but ultimately rewarding collaborative area of research. Given the richness and research potential of this area, it is essential to brainstorm and bring diverse points of view to develop underlying theory and frameworks. The mini track will attempt to accomplish these objectives. b) Chair(s): Dr. A. K. Aggarwal**  1420  410 837-5275  Dr. Doug Vogel Harbin Institute of Technology, PRC  Dr. Yuko Murayama Tsuda University, Japan    Topics The mini track will address emerging issue such as diversity, culture, adaptability and agility related to teams in distributed group decision making, as well as the underlying theories of group dynamics, coordination, communications and decision-making in distributed environments, in creation of competitive advantage.  Since team configuration and performance includes many different areas, we expect contributions from researchers beyond information system discipline.  Examples of topics in the discussion of globally distributed decision making mini-track will include the following (but are not limited to):  eCollaboration during pandemic, i.e, COVID Challenges of moving from face to face to virtual settings during pandemics Disaster planning during pandemic Comparison of platforms like Zoom, Teams, Webex for decision making Fake news impact on ecollaboration eCollaboration in distributed teams Disaster management Swift team collaboration Sub groups impact on eCollaboration Big data collaboration E-government(s) inter- , intra-collaboration  Collaboration through crowdsourcing Delivering health services through collaboration Economics of distributed decision making in the clouds Trust and distrust as motivator in distributed decision making Can agile teams be globally distributed? Agile/Adaptable team configuration in globally distributed teams The “e (internet)” to “m (mobile)” transformation of globally distributed teams Communication and coordination in globally distributed teams Diversity issues in globally distributed teams Customer satisfaction, performance and “trust” building in globally distributed  teams Synchronous and asynchronous decision making in globally distributed teams Comparison of issues across internal, inter-, intra and offshore distributed teams Turbulent economy and its impact on outsourcing Models of globally distributed agile/adaptable teams Knowledge creation, transfer and integration across globally distributed teams Leadership/cohesiveness issues in globally distributed teams Issues related to functional and dysfunctional globally distributed teams Security, privacy and risk associated with globally distributed teams Case Studies (success/failures) related to decision making by globally distributed teams  Call for paper will be listed in several listserves, conferences that mini chairs may attend and by invitation to scholars in the area.

Robot interactions with humans across an array of roles and settings pose interesting questions to scholars in various fields such as information systems, robotics, psychology, and sociology. Interaction with robots is distinct from that with other artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled technologies in that robots have a physical body that allows them to manifest physical actions. This distinguishes interactions with robots from interactions with disembodied AI agents, such as voice agents like Siri by Apple and Alexa by Amazon. Thus, research on human-robot interaction can differ significantly from that of human interaction with disembodied AI agents. The minitrack welcomes research papers that explore human‒robot interaction and robot design at any level (i.e. individual, team, organizational, and societal). This minitrack would also cover human-robot interaction as much as possible beyond the notion of “robots as teammates.” Thus, we would encourage submissions that examine many facets of interactions in any context (e.g., homes, work, and public services) and role (e.g., companion, co-worker, boss, and adversary). Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: Promoting cooperative and collaborative interaction with robots Examining uncooperative and adversarial human interactions with robots The role of adoption and appropriation in human-robot interactions Empirical studies examining the cognitive, psychological, emotional, and social aspects of human-robot interactions The impact of haptic feedback and touch on human-robot interaction The role of robot attractiveness on human-robot interaction Ethics on human-robot interactions Social-emotional models of human-robot interaction Theoretical frameworks for human-robot interaction Case studies of human-robot interaction Design implications for robot interactions at home, work and public spaces Human-oriented practices that promote human-robot interactions New methodological approaches to studying human-robot interactions"

While software has dominated  the digital world for decades, during the last years, a new wave of intelligent tools based on e.g.  data products, mixed reality, cryptography, and quantum computing has started to emerge. As a  result, disruptive transformations are being witnessed in markets, business models, jobs, and social  conventions. For understanding these emerging disruptions, a multi-dimensional interdisciplinary  examination of technologies, businesses and organizational practices is required from micro to  macro level to uncover their complex underlying socio-economic mechanisms.   Throughout its long legacy of over two decades of successful research, the BRIE-ETLA research  initiative has always explored new frontiers of digitalization and provided fresh insights on how  they shape business dynamics and societal outcomes. By engaging in the ongoing technology  trajectories and their implications at close proximity, the initiative focuses on sparking evidence- based debate on how to best navigate businesses and countries forward in periods of extreme  technology-induced turbulence.  The aim of this minitrack is to expand our knowledge on the real-world implementations and socio- economic implications of intelligent tools. In particular, the key focus will be on: 1) the role of  intelligent tools in supporting the diffusion and utilization of digital innovations; 2) the impacts of  intelligent tools on the roles and the functions of workers, organizations, markets, and governance.   The papers submitted to this call should align with at least one of the following areas of interest:  1)  The role of intelligent tools in supporting the diffusion and utilization of digital innovations  a)  Applications where automation and autonomy of products or services has increased  or decreased after the implementation of new digital technologies.  b)  Applications where automation and autonomy of manufacturing units and processes  (e.g. predictive maintenance) has increased or decreased after the implementation of  new digital technologies  c)  Applications where intelligent tools have enabled more sustainable closed-loop  systems in manufacturing, product lifecycle management, and digital services  d)  Cyber-physical systems, in which intelligent tools are seamlessly embedded with  physical resources in end-user products and services  2)  The foreseeable impacts of new intelligent tools on the roles and the functions of workers,  processes, organizations, and markets  a)  The impacts of data sharing, data portability, data products, and data markets  b)  The impacts of distributed resourcing, new co-opetition systems and integrated  digital infrastructures (e.g., systems of systems)  c)  The impacts of physics engines (e.g., Omniverse), serious games, and mixed reality  d)  The impacts of cyber-security and quantum computing, and the role of digital  cognition (e.g., deep fakes)  e)  The role and the impact of policy responses to the use of intelligent tools (e.g.,  contractual practices, standardization, legislation, and ethics)  Keywords  intelligent tools; human-machine interaction; digital innovation; machine autonomy    Fast track opportunities  There are no fast track opportunities for this proposal.

The HICSS conference publication that gave birth to this mini-track “Machines as Teammates: A research agenda on AI in team collaboration” in 2018 with its later publication in 2020 in the journal Information & Management has received thus far 170 citations. This shows that this mini-track touches upon a timely phenomenon that receives attention from the scientific community. The HICSS-55 mini-track attracted original research focusing on the emerging paradigm of machines as teammates and robust collaborators of humans. This mini-track proposal builds on  five years of success and presents the call for papers for a mini-track focused on this phenomenon. We are excited about this emerging field of human-machine collaboration and building upon a track record of success.   Short Mini-track Description The “Collaboration with Intelligent Systems:  Machines as Teammates” mini track focuses on: Human collaboration with artificial agents and intelligent systems in teams, crowds, and with individuals Design and evaluation of smart technology as team members including agent-based support (e.g., robots, chatbots) for decision makers Individual differences that impact collaboration with and acceptance of artificial intelligence Algorithmic management in teams and crowds Collaboration with agents in extended reality environments (e.g., virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality) Usability and design research for human collaboration with automated teammates Digitalization and automation of collaborative processes  Agent-based support for group facilitation including innovative facilitation methods, techniques, patterns, and procedures to improve (a)synchronous collaboration between co-located and distributed people, teams, or groups Studies and frameworks that examine trust in, satisfaction with, and expectations of artificial intelligence Design features for automated teammates that improve human collaboration with them Studies of group dynamics when an artificial teammate is on the team Methods and technologies for eliciting and capturing tacit knowledge from experts (i.e., externalization) and sharing / incorporating that knowledge into collaborative efforts with automation  Previous Mini-tracks For the past five years, we  focused on human-machine collaboration in our mini-track and have had 28 papers accepted under this topic (many more submitted). The HICSS-56 mini-track will be a continuation of this effort. The list of topics that are presented in the mini-track call for papers is updated based on the discussions at the conference, the submissions received, and our observation of the scientific trends in this domain.  Organization Support Grenoble Ecole de Management (GEM) endorses the first mini-track chair in terms of organizing the mini-track chair. The University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO) endorses the second mini-track chair both in terms of infrastructure and finances. The Auckland University of Technology supports the third chair in organizing the mini-track.   Marketing The call for papers will be sent to a mailing list of over 200 scholars who published papers in our mini-track  in the past.  We will also share the call for papers on IS-related mailings lists (e.g., WI list). Further, we will mention and distribute the call for papers at the conferences we attend (e.g., ICIS, ECIS, and AMCIS). The mini-track will also be promoted on social media platforms such as LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook as many academics are active on these platforms.

MINI-TRACK DESCRIPTION FOR PROGRAM ANNOUNCEMENT  This mini-track discusses the recent phenomenon of autonomous intelligent agents and how this next evolution of human-machine collaboration impacts individual, team and crowd dynamics. Decision-makers at all levels of organizations interact with information systems that are designed to enable better, faster, and more effective decisions. The problem is that information has reached a critical mass. The sheer volume of data and data sources make it impossible for a human being to capture and process all available and relevant data, facts, figures, etc. The need for collaborative, human-machine decision-making is increasing in importance. However, it remains unclear how to enable these new forms of effective human-machine decision-making and provide organizations with leverage.  Many pseudo-intelligent agents (e.g., chatbots, virtual assistants, advice-giving systems) are being incorporated into teams, organizations and daily life. These varied types of AI use text clues, vocal cues, or other environmental sensors to retrieve information from the user, process it, and respond appropriately. These agents help individuals complete everyday tasks such as find directions, ask for help when ordering goods or services on a website, or understand additional information about a topic or idea. Today, humans use these intelligent agents for simple, utilitarian tasks, but they are likely to progress and undertake larger and more important tasks. While intelligent agents present a potential solution, it is not fully understood how humans will actually interact with them or if humans utilize them in ways different from traditional human-to-human collaboration. As intelligent agents advance and become more ubiquitous, we need to explore new dimensions of human-machine collaboration.  This mini-track will examine the emergence of this new type of collaborating, intelligent, autonomous agents and their implications for individuals, teams, organizations, and crowds. We seek papers that address the social, technical, behavioral, attitudinal, emotional, or managerial aspects of intelligent agents in the workplace, particularly in collaboration settings. The unit of analysis can be individuals, teams, organizations, or crowds. All kinds of research is welcome including but not limited to quantitative, qualitative, conceptual, or design-oriented research.

This mini-track discusses the recent advances of autonomous intelligent agents in human-machine collaboration and how this next evolution impacts individual, team, organizational, and crowd dynamics.   Humans and machines are collaborating in new ways and organizations are increasingly leveraging human-machine teams. Decision-makers at all levels of organizations interact with information systems that are designed to enable better, faster, and more effective decisions. The problem is that information has reached a critical mass. The sheer volume of data and data sources make it impossible for a human being to capture and process all available and relevant data, facts, figures, etc. The need for collaborative, human-machine decision-making is increasing in importance. However, it remains unclear how to enable these new forms of effective human-machine decision-making and provide organization with leverage.  Machine teammates are technology-based systems that are capable of sensing, information processing, decision-making, and learning to act upon their environment and to interact with humans and other machines in order to achieve a shared task goal with more or less autonomy. These varied types of artificial intelligence (AI) use text clues, vocal cues, or other environmental sensors to retrieve information from the user, process it, and respond appropriately. These intelligent agents help individuals complete everyday tasks such as find directions, ask for help when ordering goods or services on a website, or understand additional information about a topic or idea. Today, humans use these intelligent agents for simple, utilitarian tasks, but they are likely to progress and undertake larger,more important and knowledge-intensive tasks. While intelligent agents present a potential solution, it is not fully understood about how humans will actually interact with them or if humans utilize intelligent agents in ways different from traditional human-to-human collaboration. As intelligent agents advance and become more ubiquitous, we need to explore new dimensions of human-computer collaboration.  This mini-track invites papers that will examine the emergence of this new type of collaboration and its implications for individuals, teams, organizations, and crowds.  It is focused at the intersection of human-machine collaboration.  This mini track provides one of the key international platforms on which the following issues can be discussed:  Human collaboration with artificial agents and intelligent systems in teams, crowds, and with individuals Design and evaluation of smart technology as team members including agent-based support (e.g., robots, chatbots) for decision makers Individual differences that impact collaboration with and acceptance of artificial intelligence Algorithmic management in teams and crowds Collaboration with agents in extended reality environments (e.g., virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality) Usability and design research for human collaboration with automated teammates Digitalization and automation of collaborative processes  Agent-based support for group facilitation including innovative facilitation methods, techniques, patterns, and procedures to improve (a)synchronous collaboration between co-located and distributed people, teams, or groups Studies and frameworks that examine trust in, satisfaction with, and expectations of artificial intelligence Design features for automated teammates that improve human collaboration with them Studies of group dynamics when an artificial teammate is on the team Methods and technologies for eliciting and capturing tacit knowledge from experts (i.e., externalization) and sharing / incorporating that knowledge into collaborative efforts with automation  There are no preferred methodological stances for this mini-track: this mini-track is open to both qualitative and quantitative research, to research from a positivist, interpretivist, or other theoretical perspectives, to studies from the lab, from the field, or developmental in nature.

Individuals seek out   information online for both utilitarian and hedonic reasons. Online forums are one example of a pervasive   platform where individuals can submit and receive answers to questions as well as browse the   experiences of others. Individuals with questions often turn to these forums, either directly or indirectly   (through search engine results), to find answers to problems they face. While research has begun to   address utilitarian and hedonic seeking and consumption of information, there is still much left unknown.   This mini-track focuses on research related to understanding information processing and decision making   in the context of online communities. The following is a list of sample topics (non-exhaustive) that would   be a good fit for this mini-track:   ●   How individuals search for, filter, or adopt online information   ●   Online decision-making processes   ●   Cognitive processing related to consumption of online information   ●   Validation of online content   ●   Community based cues   ●   Evaluation of different cue types (e.g., upvotes, star ratings)   ●   Design elements of tools to support online communities   ●   Crowdsourced knowledge   ●   Approaches to increase contributions/engagement   ●   Novel approaches to support online communities   Journals - Fast Track   None currently. We’re investigating an opportunity, but nothing set.   Marketing Plan   Over the past decade we have conducted research on the mini-track topic and want to bring together   like-minded researchers to formalize the conversation around these topics. We ran a similar mini-track at   AMCIS 2021. We plan to recruit those that submit and review for the mini-track. We will make specific   invitations to researchers that are already publishing in this area (we have started a list) and of course   advertise more broadly on traditional channels.

"HICSS-56","CL","Collaboration Systems and Technologies","7facdfe0-404a-4a5e-9353-c7e51318b82d","Open Science Practices in Information Systems Research","Minitrack Title: Open science practices in information systems research  Research track that this minitrack belongs  Collaboration Systems and Technologies  Description of the minitrack  The traditional scientific process consists of identifying a research problem, setting  research questions, gathering, analysing and interpreting data, and publishing the  results (often in an academic outlet). However, with the advent of information  technology, and the internet, the expectations for conducting, publishing, and  communicating research has changed drastically, where scientists are no longer  restricted by this traditional scientific process. Instead, scientists have started to  adopt more open approaches to their research projects, which has seen open  science (OS) growing in prominence in recent years, and is challenging this  traditional scientific process used in information systems (IS) research. OS refers to  making scientific knowledge freely available to the public, where open practices are  becoming a requirement to be eligible for funding from most competitive funding  schemes.    OS consists of different concepts such as open access (making published research  articles freely  available  under  an  open  access  licence); open data (requiring  researchers to make research data publicly available with their submitted papers);  open methodology (sharing methodological details, such as data collection and  analysis processes); open artefact(s) (making artefacts accessible online for free,  with an open license to use,modify and reuse); and open peer review (where  researchers and reviewers know each others identities). The impact of OS can be  seen through the use of registered reports (RR), which facilitate a form of peer  review that breaks studies into two stages: (i) study pre-registration - authors identify  a relevant problem and detail their research design, which is submitted for (open)  peer review and feedback, (ii) improved research execution - the study is completed  with the improved design.    The objective of this minitrack is to give researchers the opportunity to present novel  and innovative ways that they are conducting research using OS concepts outlined  above. In doing so we aim to push the boundary of how IS research is conducted  and communicated to the community. Indeed, OS should be more transparent, with  greater potential to verify, replicate, and freely share the results. Such openness  should also provide a platform for creating research that demonstrates proof-of-use  as the community strives to become more relevant to practice. We therefore suggest  that the community should strongly engage with OS, and in order to do so, we are  looking for both conceptual and empirical papers that either further our  understanding of OS in IS research, or studies that practice it.     Thus, we invite papers that focus on (but is not limited to) any of the following topics  around open science in IS research:    ●  Philosophical considerations  ●  Ethical implications   ●  Methodological considerations  ●  Policies of open science  ●  Papers that practice one (or more) concepts of open science in their study  ●  Registered reports in IS research (can be either stage 1 or stage 2)  ●  Understanding of different platforms/tools/technologies for practicing open  science  ●  Success/Failure cases that have arisen while practicing open science  ●  How we can improve or innovate open science practices  ●  Benefits of practicing open science  ●  Challenges and/or problems with practicing open science  Marketing Plan  To attract submissions to the minitrack we'll disseminate the call and description  through a number of methods including:  ●  Posting to the AISWorld and Wirtschaftsinformatik mailing lists  ●  Posting (with permission) in open science networks such as ANZORN, Open  Science (@_open_science_), and the ACM Emerging Interest Group on  Reproducibility and Independent Verification  ●  Posting to our own social media connections, along with the use of relevant  tags such as #openscienceinis, #openscience, and #registeredreports   ●  We will also use the networks of our colleagues, requesting if they would  promote the post in their own networks  Journals for fast track opportunities  N/A  Minitrack Chair  Name: Dr. Cathal Doyle   Affiliation: Victoria University of Wellington  Contact information: cathal.doyle@vuw.ac.nz   Bio: Cathal is a lecturer in information systems at the School of Information  Management at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand.

With greater connectivity brought about by the  proliferation of internetworking technologies, it has become much easier for individuals to circumvent  spatial and temporal barriers during interactions, thereby giving rise to Sharing Economy platforms that  are structured around the disintermediation of conventional channels of commerce in the exchange of both  tangible and intangible resources. The sharing economy has gained notable attention within mainstream  media as a new economic paradigm that leverages peer-to-peer technological platforms to facilitate the  exchange of resources among individuals who are joined via fluid relational networks. Almost overnight,  numerous peer-to-peer platforms—in the likes of crowdworking (e.g., Airbnb, Uber, Amazon Mechanic  Turk, E-Lance, Fiverr), coinnovation (e.g., Mindmixer, Social Innovator), crowdfunding (e.g., Kickstarter,  Indiegogo), crowdsearching (e.g., Crowdfynd, CrowdSearching), and crowdvoting (e.g., California Report  Card, Threadless) — have sprung up to facilitate both individuals and/or organizations to pool resources in  resolving problems.  While there are many practitioners who have prophesized the sharing economy as a game-changer for how  organizations and society function, there are also a number of detractors who questioned the uncertain and  potentially disruptive future that is brought about by such peer-to-peer exchanges. Critics have painted a  dismal picture of the sharing economy as a means for individuals and/or firms to dodge proper regulations  and live beyond their means, which in turn contributes to doomsday scenarios of massive job displacements  and spending habits detrimental to society. In light of the opportunities and challenges posed by the sharing  economy, there is a clear urgency for systematic and thorough scrutiny of how value creation and  appropriation can take place within such economic environments while minimizing its negative impact on  society.  The aim of this mini-track is to sensitize both academics and practitioners to the latest trends and  developments in the sharing economy in order to determine how value can be created and appropriated  within this novel economic environment powered primarily by technology. This mini-track embraces both  retrospective and progressive views of how the sharing economy has evolved and would transform with  technological advances. We welcome papers that identify and address knowledge gaps in how emergent  technologies are shaping the access and sharing of resources within online peer-to-peer communities.  Papers that subscribe to inter-disciplinary perspectives, adopt mixed methods, and/or study new emerging  cases are particularly welcome.  Our topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  §  Disruptive innovation in the sharing economy  §  The sharing economy and globalization  §  The sharing economy and digital transformation  §  The sharing economy and digital platform design  §  The sharing economy and socio-economic/political challenges  §  The sharing economy and policies and regulation  §  The sharing economy business models and strategies  §  Collaborative production, commercialization, and consumption in sharing economy  §  Crowdfunding and communal investment  §  Crowdsourcing and open innovation  §  The dark sides of the sharing economy  §  The design and evaluation of the sharing economy platforms  §  The governance of the sharing economy platforms  §  Actor behavior and network structure in the sharing economy  §  Effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on sharing economy activities    Best papers accepted to this mini-track will be fast-tracked to Internet Research, an international and  refereed journal that is indexed and abstracted in major databases (e.g., SSCI, SCI, ABI/INFORM Global).    Marketing Plan    The mini track chairs have had extensive experience serving as conference board members, track chairs,  and associate editors for related topics in conferences affiliated with the Association for Information  Systems (AIS) and HCI International.

With the widespread popularity of social media technologies, the pervasive expansion of immediate many-to-many connections has introduced new dynamics amongst and between users, companies, and advocates that pertain to all forms of political, economic, and personal life. While these dynamics imply various positive consequences for the civil society (e.g., greatly unrestrained access to sharing and collecting information), they also introduce severe issues of coordinated adversary behaviors (e.g., coordinated inauthentic behavior, cybermobbing, distortion of the public discourse, proliferation of unreliable information, relinquished on- and offline privacy).  The rise of coordinated adversarial behaviors in collaboration and social media systems deserves more scholarly and public attention, because of their devastating consequences to individuals and society. Furthermore, system providers and platform regulators struggle to develop effective means to counteract these undesirable and destructive issues. There is also a need to conduct theory-guided studies to investigate prevention and intervention strategies for coordinated adversary behaviors in collaboration and social media systems. Thus, the aim of this minitrack is to identify, conceptualize, and assess these emergent cutting-edge issues as well as their actual or potential counter mechanisms.  The minitrack intends to inform the respective decision making of regulators and tech companies from an Information Systems standpoint. Researchers are invited to adopt a pessimistic perspective (i.e., the extent to which collaboration and social media systems cause or prolong problems) or an optimistic view (i.e., ways to prevent and mitigate these problems) when addressing coordinated adversarial behaviors in collaboration and social media systems. We also welcome papers examining the synergies of collaboration and social media systems and exploring the potential, social and other impacts of integrated systems. This minitrack is open to all types of research, conceptual, theoretical, and/or empirical. Examples of possible topics of interest include (but are not limited to): Topics: Cybermobbing, cyberbullying, cyberharassment, online disinhibition, hate speech, trolling, deceptive communication Digital vigilantism, shaming, doxing, hacktivism, human flesh search engine Violent online extremism and cyberterrorism Fake news, deception, participatory or bot-driven disinformation campaigns Coordinated inauthentic behavior, astroturfing, sockpuppeting Network polarization, echo-chambers, filter bubbles Prevention and intervention mechanisms, balancing the protection of civil liberties and national security, censorship, deplatforming, content monitoring Policy, governance, and platform (self) regulation Privacy protection and violations, dark pattern design   Mini-track Co-Chairs:  Prof. Christy M.K.

Additionally, their stakeholders are more and more intensely digitalized and interconnected, increasing potential risks but also revealing new opportunities at anytime and anywhere. In such a context, managers, public and governemental authorities must rethink their decision support systems to remain competitive and sustainable globally. In all domains, Digital and Hyperconnected SCSs will soon be the new normal. Collaborative networked systems should be opportunity-oriented to build agreements on-the-fly and get exceptional results. Such systems are bound to gradually move from being driven by long-term strategic alliances, as it systematically exists in public sector, to being opportunity-driven goal-oriented networks. More recently, authors showed that these systems are more and more intensely interconnected on multiple layers, ultimately anytime and anywhere. The interconnectivity layers notably include digital, physical, operational, business, legal and personal layers. This new state is notably called “hyperconnectivity” in the “Physical Internet” framework. Such a state implies numerous new opportunities for managers, authorities, particularly regarding the possibility for SCSs to become more flexible, dynamically driven and open instead of rigid, planned with static policies and dedicated. This allows considering a set of partners and infrastructures not limited to the known and active ones, opening avenues and degrees of freedom when aiming to catch opportunities on the fly as they occur. One of the serious challenges relate to develop resilient, sustainable and efficient SCSs. Unfortunately, to date, very few practices and research works support this ambition. Consequently, managers and authorities are looking for innovative systems and associated decision support systems designed to engineer, improve and manage their activities in this new typical environment. This minitrack features digitalized and hyperconnected SCs engineering and management, participating in the development of a more efficient, resilient and sustainable society. These issues should be tackled at each level of the governance. We invite papers that deal with any aspect of the analysis, design, development, deployment, implementation, integration, improvement, use or evaluation of SCSs, in a highly digitalized and/or interconnected context. Besides, we support innovative and break-through visions regarding digitalization and hyperconnectivity capabilities and their applications.

If your proposal is accepted, this will be included in the HICSS-56 website  The Advances in Teaching and Learning Technologies (ATLT) minitrack encourages research  contributions that deal with learning theories, teaching tools and their development, distance  learning, supporting infrastructures, user experiences and feedback, learning analytics and  measurable outcomes as they relate to the area of technology and its support of improving  teaching and learning. Especially, the current increasing demand on hybrid learning and emerging  remote learning models have challenged multidisciplinary research for advancing the design,  development, and implementation of effective teaching and learning technologies. Furthermore,  the recent progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other advanced technologies have  brought  novel  opportunities  for  transforming  the  education  landscape.  The  use  of  AI  and  advanced technologies into learning environments invites new questions,  applications, and  research methodologies. How, for example, does technology integration and remote teaching  augment how people learn?, and Can we effectively develop agency, trust, analytics, feedback,  and interventions to support learning in complex environments where boundaries between human  and artificial cognition and knowledge processes become blurred? What new capability and  research will this integration bring and how will it advance our current understanding of learning?  To leverage the HICSS context, we seek to bridge disciplines and research communities between  system sciences, AI, computer and learning sciences, so within this scope a broad range of  research questions, learning settings, and theoretical and methodological traditions will be  considered. We are flexible about what constitutes 'learning' (e.g., acquisition or co-creation of  knowledge or skills, intersubjective meaning-making, advancing community and network learning,   collective change) and about the nature of the setting (e.g., face-to-face or online; formal or    informal; educational, workplace or leisure and mixtures thereof; with diverse technological media  and artificial intelligence mediating networked or community social interaction), but learning and  the Collaboration Systems and Technology setting should be considered in relation to each other  rather than one without regard for the other.    Papers should make a theoretical and/ or empirical contribution or establish the value of a  methodological or design innovation: it is not sufficient to merely document use of a technology  in a learning context or apply a well-worn model without new insights.          *Shortened version to be included in the Advance Program Announcement.  The Advances in Teaching and Learning Technologies (ATLT) minitrack encourages paper  submissions that deal with theories, tools, platforms, infrastructures, experiences, methods, or  outcomes as they relate to the area of innovative technology, learning analytics and its support of  the  learning  and  development  process  in  educational,  workplace  and  leisure  settings.    In  particular, the current shift to online teaching and learning brought new methodological and  technological  challenges.  This  change  requires  innovative  ways  to  bring  students  and  professionals together, improve collaboration and learning experiences, and support diverse  learning settings.      *Marketing Plan  The ATLT community has grown considerably in the last several years. Our LinkedIn group  HICSS-ATLT (https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13862522/) has already 70+ members. We also  disseminate our minitrack information via Academia and Researchgate and to learning research  communities such as the Society for Learning Analytics Research and Networked Learning.  Chairs are on the editorial board at SN Social Science journal  (https://www.springer.com/journal/43545), Research at Network Learning  (https://www.springer.com/series/11810), and Policy Futures in Education  (https://journals.sagepub.com/home/pfe).

The Text Mining and Analytics minitrack is also built on the successful HICSS tutorials on Text Mining we have organized since HICSS-48.  At HICSS-51, we had over 90 registered participants for the text mining tutorial, including 19 doctoral students. We had 75 registered participants for HICSS-52, with very good participation throughout the entire tutorial. For HICSS-53, we had 45 registered participants, with close to 50 participating throughout the entire tutorial. At HICSS-52, even though our minitrack session was in the last slot on the last day, we had a great turnout and four excellent papers, which were well received by the participants.  For HICSS-53, we built on the integration between the text mining tutorial and the minitrack and had more submissions and greater participation in our two sessions. At the virtual HICSS-54, we had a very successful virtual minitrack, with 19 participants, and three excellent papers presented. Again, at the virtual HICSS-55, we held a very successful online tutorial, with 79 people registered for the Zoom session, and approximately 55 attending the entire three-hour session: and breaking into two hands-on text mining tutorials, one using the open source R programming language in RStudio and the other using the commercial Wordstat text mining software. For HICSS-56 we will continue to build on these strategies to further strengthen our Minitrack on Text Mining and Analytics. This minitrack recognizes the reality that global collaboration systems, social media, and information systems of all types, generate enormous amounts of unstructured textual data, including: system logs, email archives, websites, blog posts, meeting transcripts, speeches, annual reports, published material, and social media posts.  While this unstructured textual data is readily available, it presents tremendous challenges to researchers trying to analyze these large bodies of text with traditional content analytical methods. Text mining and analytics are increasingly important techniques for an interdisciplinary group of scholars, practitioners, government officials, and international organizations.  For example, the data science community Kaggle provides some excellent text datasets and ongoing competitions (). Also, the number of text mining and analytics courses being taught at the graduate and undergraduate levels continues to expand, including Dr. Cogburn’s course on text mining. We have also secured a fast track to journal publishing opportunity for our text mining and analytics minitrack with the peer-reviewed, open access journal Data & Policy (). The Minitrack on Text Mining and Analytics is designed to provide a highly engaging interactive forum and community for researchers and practitioners to discuss the critical issues related to text mining and analytics and contribute to the ongoing big data focus at HICSS.  The HICSS-56 Minitrack on Text Mining and Analytics invites papers using both theoretical and applied text mining approaches to analyze various genres of text data, including, but not limited to: Blog posts Twitter and social media Email archives Published articles Websites Meeting and call center transcripts Speeches Online discussion forums Online communities Computer logs Incident and maintenance reports Patents Contracts Legal Documents Public policies and public comments News transcripts Published articles Customer feedback Resumes and CVs Employee evaluations Insurance claims Annual reports  And papers addressing methodological challenges, such as: Automated acquisition and cleaning data “Bag of Words” approaches, including dictionaries and sentiment analysis Syntactic parsing and robust Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques including Named Entity Recognition (NER), word embedding, and Bidirectional Encoder Representation Transformers (BERT) Supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques Using LDA, LSA, and other topic modeling techniques Text summarization, classification, and clustering. Working on distributed, high-performance computers Overcoming API limitations.  Additional Opportunity: HICSS-56 Textathon on the HICSS Papers Corpus  In addition to all the other possibilities for participating in the Text Mining and Analytics minitrack, new for HICSS-56 is the opportunity to submit a paper based on an analysis of the HICSS paper corpus.  This initiative is tied to a loosely organized textathon focused on the collection of HICSS papers. Researchers interested in participating in the textathon should register by the deadline to receive access to the dataset. There are three streams of the competition: Stream 1: Basic “Bag of Words” Approaches: is for researchers interested primarily in statistical “bag of words” approaches to text mining, including keyword and phrase frequency analysis, and the development and application of dictionaries (including sentiment analysis). Stream 2 Syntactic Parsing and NLP Approaches: is for researchers taking a syntactic parsing and Natural Language Processing approach to text mining, including Named Entity Recognition (NER), word embedding, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) techniques. Stream 3 Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches: is for researchers interested in taking supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches, including topic modeling, k-means clustering, document classification, and prediction. While participants in the textathon will register in one of the three streams, they may use any text mining technique or combination of techniques they choose to derive insights of value from the HICSS paper corpus. The top two papers in each stream will be presented at an afternoon workshop at HICSS-56 called “Workshop on Text Mining and Analytics: Understanding the HICSS Conference Paper Corpus Through Multifaceted Text Mining Techniques.” Researchers participating in the textathon who want to submit a paper for review by the Text Mining and Analytics minitrack must submit their papers to the minitrack via the HICSS paper system by the 15 June 2022 deadline.  Minitrack Relevance:  The analysis of various forms of text is increasingly important at HICSS, which was ahead of many other international professional and academic conferences in including this area. For example, the International Conference on Text Analytics, Big Data and Law will be held in Rome, Italy from 18-19 January 2023 . Also, from 19-20 February 2022, the 2nd International Conference on NLP and Text Mining (NLTM 2022) will be held in Dubai, UAE (). From 15-16 February 2022 the International Conference on Data and Text Mining in Biomedical Informatics (ICDTMBI 2022) will be held in Barcelona, Spain: ). Previously, from 19-20 April 2021, the Association for Computational Linguistics organized the 12th International workshop on Health Text Mining and Information Analysis (). In 2020 and 2021, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) organized the 2020 Text Analysis Conference in Washington, DC form 17-18 November 2021 (). In 2020, NIST also organized the Text Analysis Conference (TAC), which was organized into three “tracks” focused on different approaches to a common dataset: . In 2014, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) launched a new competition on Big Data and Analytics within its highly competitive senior executive branch fellowship program.  The review panel for this prestigious fellowship was chaired by the chair of the HICSS Text Analytics minitrack Dr. Derrick L. Cogburn. In 2014, The Big Boulder Initiative was formed. It is a trade association wholly dedicated to “the advancement of social data in businesses and organizations of all kinds.”   A 2013 IEEE Conference on Big Data Analytics from 6-9 October 2013 in Santa Clara, CA: , highlighted original research on the 5Vs of Big Data (Volume, Velocity, Variety, Value and Veracity).  The Big Data Innovation Summit, highlighted for participants the value of customer data: .  Finally, the 11th Annual Text and Social Analytics from 5-6 June 2013 in Boston, MA helped reinforce the importance of text analyst to insights gained from big data. .  Related Publications:  A recent 2020 publication related to the proposed workshop is entitled, “Applying Text Analytics for Studying Research Trends in Dependability” (Carnot, Bernardino, Laranjeiro, and Oliveira, 2020. . Another from 2017 is entitled, “Trends in Topics at SE Conferences (1993-2013), (Matthew, Agrawal, and Menzies, 2017). . Another is “Investigation of Topic Trends in Computer and Information Science by Text Mining Techniques: From the Perspective of Conferences in DBLP (Kim, Song, and Song, 2015). . One from 2014 is entitled, “Big Data Analytics: A Text Mining-Based Literature Analysis” (Elragal and Haddara, 2014).   Marketing Plan:  We plan to market the minitrack as follows: Contact by email everyone that participated in our HICSS text mining tutorials and minitracks from 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 and the other related tutorials, workshops, and minitracks at HICSS-55 and invite them to submit a paper for HICSS-56. Encourage them to forward the email to potentially interested colleagues. Contact anyone who submitted a paper to HICSS related to text mining and encourage them to submit to this minitrack. Contact participants at other workshops and tutorials on text mining conducted by the minitrack chairs, inviting them to submit a paper.

In academia and industry, extensive discussions on biased data sets and algorithms triggered talks on achieving fairness, non-biased, risk-averse and trustworthy AI.  We would be interested in learning how to synchronise technology advances, principles and practices of Data Science, abundance of data processed through AI, and automatic generation of algorithmic predictions through various software tools.  Whether we are waiting for a new way of looking at the problem of transparency of AI or creating a new computational paradigm, which would automatically detect hidden dangers in data sets and associated algorithms, we need to engage in wider talks across communities which have impact on or are affected by the current status of AI. We invite a spectrum of papers, which highlight any of our concerns and the topics below, and thus help us to cut through the current hype of AI.  Discussions at the HICSS conference would answer many AI questions we may have and show a vision where the world of algorithmic computing in AI might be heading.  We are particularly interested in the impact the Data Science.  At the time of writing this proposal, we could not find a conference, which comprehensively addresses the way we create algorithmic computations, and thus would like to debate if Data Science practices might be contributing towards creating more obscurity of AI algorithms. The co-relation between Data Science practices and AI algorithms is obvious, but we still look at the two of them separately without evaluating the impact they may have on each other. We would also welcome the applications of these novel research results in cyber physical spaces, pervasive and intelligent healthcare, medicine, robotics, smart cities and autonomous transport, automation, IoT and many more.   Indicative Topics are: Evaluation of AI Algorithms Multidisciplinary nature of AI evaluations Methods of evaluating and explaining AI algorithms and their complexities  Computational paradigm and frameworks for evaluating ML and AI Algorithms Reconstructing AI algorithms from their descriptions and explanations Automatic creation of transparent AI models and algorithms Software testing and AI: Testing AI and its algorithms using software testing principles and methods Adaptation of software testing to specificity of AI-based software solutions Interpretability of algorithms through models and criteria for decision making  The pace of AI innovation and responses of society Social and legal outcome of fair algorithms Intentioanl and unintentational consequences of using AI potential harm to people resulting from algorithmic opacity Human centred AI Human AI interaction for achieving fair, responsible, and acceptable outcome of using AI  AI for understanding humans and vice versa Ethics, legal and socio-technical issues in AI based systems Ethical issues and sharing principles in designing AI algorithms AI monitoring and regulations AI Algorithmic harm: dishonesty, fairness and lack of awareness in AI The risk of NOT using AI  Obscurity of AI Algorithms Impenetrable obscurity of AI AI evaluation and seeing “what is inside the black box” Black-box functions in AI and decision making Human control in AI based systems versus black box algorithms versus transparency in AI Trade-off between algorithmic decision making in and transparency of AI-based systems AI accountability regime and the level of human trusts built by algorithms Accountability versus responsibility in AI based systems Performance of transparent AI models and algorithms  AI Algorithms, Fairness and Data Science Identifying BIAS which matters BIASED AI and automatic decision making BIASED semantic representation of data and human BIAS Abstractions in machine learning algorithms and fairness Impact of Data Science practices on semantic of data in training/learning algorithms Feature selection and engineering in machine learning versus fairness of algorithms where it is used Impact of feature selection on the testing/ training data sets which may  affects fairness and discover harms of AI  Co-relation between Data Science practices and AI computational models Discovering fairness in AI algorithms through the semantic stored in data sets Impact of statistical methods on Data Science and on the evaluation/transparency/obscurity of AI ______________________________________________  The co-hairs’ employers endorse their involvement and will pay for our travel and registration cost to attend HICSS.  In this year, we left the proposal similar to the last year, except for adding a few topics on human centred AI and their co-relation with human beings, as a part of our attempt to enrich the topics related to the pace of AI innovation and responses of society.  We also introduce the problem of feature selection in ML, which can directly influence the fairness and relationship between humans and AI.

Big data sources have scaled beyond the capacities and capabilities of commercial database management systems. Structured representations become a bottleneck to efficient data storage and retrieval for unstructured and more complex data. Kaisler, Armour, Espinosa (2013) have noted five major challenges associated with big data (the five Vs): increasing volume of data, increasing velocity (e.g., in/out and change of data), increasing variety of data types and structures, determining the veracity of data, and understanding the value that big data brings to the decision-making process.   Over the past 10 years, an increasing number of disciplines and problem domains have been identified where big data is having an impact. Each year one sees an increase in the number of challenges and opportunities for big data to have a major impact on business, social and physical sciences. Besides the technical challenges of managing and utilizing big data effectively, there are several business and organizational challenges that come with the use of big data, such as: data governance and curation, information security, privacy, big data strategy, management of human resources, the business value of big data investments, ethical considerations, and coordination of big data initiatives, among other things.  Big Data Analytics is continuing to mature as a discipline, but one in need of distinguishing methodologies and tools and effective business approaches. The challenges and opportunities have multiplied over the past several years and continue to grow. As the plethora of data grows, new methods are required to gather, manage, process and understand the data in order to provide actionable information for decision-makers, matching the domain knowledge and problems with specific missions and constraints. We are seeing competing approaches in research, emphasizing explainable (i.e., interpretable) models pitted against black-box, uninterpretable but highly accurate models. More research is needed to understand the business value of the benefits and shortcomings of various approaches within this continuum.  The emergence of streaming analytics with (near) real-time data processing has motivated significant attention to storage and processing performance. New metrics are required to assess its impact on decision-making in each domain where success is defined in mission-based terms. Assessing the value generated through analytics within decision-making processes is an open research problem because it (often) requires maintaining the provenance of data as its progresses through an analytical framework.  Data Science/Analytic Science Big Data has contributed to the field of Data Science, which is an analytics-based discipline that generates new data representations from existing data through transformation, translation, integration, and data mining – among other techniques. Data science and business analytics are largely grounded on statistics, data engineering, data mining, decision analysis and descriptive and predictive modeling.  Data science has matured rapidly, and many techniques and methods are now familiar to data scientists.  We are also beginning to see more research on approaches that use a blend of various methods, rather than single ones. For example, natural language processing and text mining are often used to develop actor or entity relationships in the text, which are then analyzed using graph theory and network analytics. Similarly, we are seeing more visual analytics complementing quantitative analytics, which is becoming a prevalent approach on social media and social network analytics. It is our belief that new computational methods using a variety of analytic tools and methods, other than statistics will become increasingly more important.  We term this approach Analytic Science. The analytic scientist will be not just the statistician, number cruncher and data visualizer – as many bloggers have put it – but will evolve to be a renaissance system scientist who will possess a wide variety of skills and knowledge suitable to exploring big data, grounded in domain knowledge and have expertise that informs both predictive and prescriptive analytics.  Numerous universities have created new degree programs and research centers in Data Science and Business and Data Analytics. Our host institutions – American University and George Washington University – are among these. Our co-chairs, J. Alberto Espinosa and Frank Armour at American University, devised a body of knowledge framework as a basis for grounding Big Data and Business Analytics curricula. J. Alberto Espinosa architected and designed the curriculum and lead the implementation of two M.S. Analytics programs (campus and online). He also teaches business process analysis, predictive analytics and graph and network analytics.  Frank Armour is presently the Director of American University’s Business Analytics program. Frank Armour teaches database, big data, business analytics and text analytics.   Alberto Espinosa is the architect for the MS Analytics programs and undergraduate specialization on business analytics at American University’s Kogod School of Business.   Steve Kaisler has been teaching Big Data and Analytics at George Washington University’s Computer Science Department for the past years.   The co-chairs along with William Money of The Citadel have co-authored a two volume book on Obtaining Value from Big Data for Service Systems, published by Business Expert Press.  Paper submissions on the structure and evaluation of curriculum design, implementation and evaluation for big data and analytics are welcome.  Big Data and Analytics: Organizational Issues As a recent Bloomberg BusinessWeek survey of 930 businesses pointed out, business analytics is a field in an “emerging state”. While we grapple with the technical issues associated with big data and analytics, the associated organizational and business issues are beginning to mount into substantial piles. Research in information systems has seen significant intellectual contributions over the last 30 years in areas like: the business value of IT; modeling IS success human-computer interaction; technology adoption; and coordination in technology work; just to name a few. This emerging field has re-energized IS and IT research and brought its visibility to new levels, but there is little research in any of the business and organizational aspects of big data and analytics. This represents a deep knowledge gap in the research literature.   Consequently, we propose this mini track to solicit paper submissions that: advance our knowledge of Big Data storage and structure; help us learn about effective processes and approaches to effectively manage Big Data and the associated business analytics; begin to identify ways to measure the organizational benefits derived from using and analyzing Big Data; present case studies of Big Data implementation and use; address the design and development of analytical frameworks that incorporate multiple analytic methods and techniques based on different architectures and technologies; and address the organizational and business aspects of big data and analytics. Papers will be solicited in several areas, including, but not limited to the following:   Challenges in managing big data repositories and projects – exabytes and beyond. Analytics Enterprise Governance:  Including data standardization, privacy and security  Graph analytics – both syntactic and semantic – that play a big role in the exploitation of social media data. Advanced analytics, – emphasizing visual analytics and non-numeric analysis models and their implementation as applied to complex problems in different domains Scalable semantic annotation and reasoning across big data stores. Metrics for assessing the impact of big data in business, scientific, and governmental decision-making. Evaluation, analysis and comparison of explainable vs. black-box models. Organizational and business aspects of big data, analytics and data science. Educational and body of knowledge frameworks on big data, analytics, data science and analytic science. Analytics for large-scale, fast and unstructured changes in very large data sets – petabytes and beyond. The changing nature of analytics from precise modeling to fast, adaptive computational intelligence for handling imprecise knowledge. Big data and analytics as enabling technologies for a smart society – smart cities, aging populations, and responses to critical environmental and geopolitical problems. New analytics as the basis for cognitive computing and connected (possibly distributed) intelligence that augments human decision-making.    Challenges in managing big data repositories The primary representation schemes for big data have revolved around the use of NoSQL database systems and RDF, RDFS, and associated specifications. A critical question is whether NoSQL databases can scale to the exabyte range or beyond. Scaling of existing data repositories (relational DBMS, RDF flat files, HDFS, data lakes, etc.) beyond the exabyte range is an open research problem. A few data sets of exabyte size exist in distributed systems, but it is difficult to evaluate practically or theoretically whether such systems will scale.  Research into the performance of distributed NoSQL databases and new repository structures is urgently required as exabyte data sets have become the new benchmark for very large data sets and zettabyte databases are emerging for many governmental and scientific applications.  New representation schemes for unstructured data, particularly large volumes of text, audio and video files, are of especial interest. Research is required in real-time analytics infused with domain knowledge. New algorithms for real-time stream processing of large volumes of data at terabit and petabit speeds need to be developed and new data structures and storage systems created to accept and organize such data.  Graph analytics – both syntactic and semantic As RDF/RDFS describes a graph through linked data, numerous analytics based on mathematical graph theory have been designed and applied to big data. These syntactic algorithms along with statistical approaches have been the basis for much of data science. Research is required in advanced algorithms based on domain knowledge and model-driven approaches to analyzing linked data graphs that scale no worse than O(n2). As graphs and networks become richer in their descriptive power and multiple edges connect nodes within the graph (meshes), algorithms become more complex as more possible paths through the mesh emerge. New mechanisms for annotating nodes and edges which become complex data structures in their own right are required. New algorithms which are parallelizable in order to ensure timely execution are also required. New methods are required for visualizing complex multidimensional graphs and meshes representing data on the petabyte and exabyte scale.  Advanced Analytics Big data has been processed using parallel systems – both hardware and software. MPI and MapReduce are two systems that have been used to develop analytics. ScalaPython, as well as other programming languages, are beginning to replace MapReduce as the implementing system for Big Data because of their interactive capabilities.  Research is required into other types of analytic frameworks suitable for large-scale (e.g., thousands to millions of processors) parallel processing. Advanced analytics seek to derive meaningful information from very large complex data sets. We have characterized the extremes as “finding the needle in the haystack” and “turning straw into gold”. Papers describing analytics applied to any large data volume representation are sought, particularly those that can provide a competitive advantage through business intelligence. Papers are also sought in multi-format data analytics and visual analytics. While analytic algorithms can reduce big data to actionable information, the resulting data may still be very large. Research into innovative techniques for data and information visualization, including 3D and other sensory modalities, is required to assist decision-makers in quickly grasping the importance of processed data within specific domains.  Qualitative versus Quantitative Analytics Much of the Big Data analysis reported over the past few years has used quantitative methods to analyze data. However, researchers are realizing that quantitative methods some of the underlying information that would answer the question “why?”. There is an emerging interest in using qualitative analytics to process big data concurrently with quantitative methods. Papers focused on the description and application of qualitative methods to Big Data are solicited.  Metrics for assessing the impact of big data The contribution of big data to decision making requires new metrics for assessing the five Vs mentioned above, particularly the value proposition. Few such metrics exist today. Research into metrics will require domain knowledge and, include sizing and incremental changes to decisions based on streaming data, and identifying tipping points in decisions and the effect of uncertainty in large masses of data. In addition, an understanding of the methods used to submit the results of big data analysis to decision makers, time frames required, and types of decisions incorporating big data findings are appropriate for submission.  Edge Analytics to Facilitate Real-time Processing of Streaming Data As streaming data speeds increase, we may not be able to store the data fast enough or it may be so perishable that it is no longer worth processing if we have to store it first, then process it. Edge Analytics moves the information processing mechanisms to the location where the data is collected; makes perishability decisions; processes data as it is collected; and determines what needs to be forward to storage mechanisms and what can be discarded. It provides (near) real-time processing of data through multiple analytics to facilitate (near) real-time decision-making. High performance algorithms running on high performance platforms are required to deliver the required performance.  Big Data and Analytics: Issues and Challenges We published a paper titled “Big Data Redux: Issues and Challenges” in the HICSS-52 Proceedings, which reviewed the state of Big Data since our first paper was published in 2013 (which now has over 100 citations). We found that several areas dominated the research in areas mentioned in our paper, while some areas were neglected. We highlight these neglected areas in order to seek papers to advance the Big Data and Analytics field: data storage and transport, analytic complexity, privacy, security, governance, compliance, and data ownership, system and software architecture. Little has been written about the analytical challenges of developing sound prescriptive models that can leverage the potential of BDA. We also note that spatial analytics and visualization analytics are receiving greater attention as new applications for emerge that support decision-making in complex domains.  Relation to other Big Data and Business Analytics Minitracks: There were 22 or more mini tracks across HICSS-54 that mentioned “big data” and “analytics” in their titles. Within the Decision Analytics track, there were 8 such mini tracks, some of which were hard to differentiate. Perhaps the closest analog is the “Business Analytics/Business Intelligence …” minitrack in “Organizational Systems and Technology”, but it seems to be more focused on theory building and design research rather than the analytics themselves. The Program Chair and the Track Chairs have determined to reduce the overlap among minitracks to provide clearly identifiable and focused forums for researchers to submit their papers. We support this effort and have adjusted our minitrack proposal accordingly based on discussion with the Decision Analytics track co-chairs. However, the proliferation of “Big Data” and “Analytics” minitracks across HICSS may be diluting the impact of this theme. Some consolidation of minitrack topics related to Big Data and Analytics is recommended.  At HICSS-53, the minitrack co-chairs offered two half-day tutorials: Forensic Analysis of Failed Software Projects Both tutorials had significant pre-registration for the conference, and had the attendance of over 30 people at the conference, the majority of them walk-ins rather than pre-registrants. Each session – two for each tutorial had several participants attending. The DA Big Data minitrack sessions at HICSS-54 had over 25 attendees in its virtual session hosted on Zoom.  HICSS represents a major venue for presenting current research, practice, and case studies on big data and semantic reasoning. We continue to evolve our understanding of Big Data and Analytics in order to attract high-quality papers in innovative technologies, methods, practices, and applications.   Two special issues of the journal International Journal of Systems and Service-Oriented Engineering (IJSSOE), published by IGI, featured several papers from the HICSS Big Data minitrack. We are currently assessing other journals, such as the Communications of the Association for Information Systems (CAIS), to determine how to prepare special issues on Big Data and Analytics.  Other Conferences: A survey of other conferences indicates that many are run by commercial organizations, such as the Big Data Conference , Government Big Data Conference , IEEE International Conference on Big Data, O’Reilly’s Strata , and many others, etc. All attest to the importance of this topic in the business, scientific, and governmental domains. Many of these seemed to focus on data warehousing, data querying, data mining, and data science. The major professional societies sponsor several big data conferences which demonstrate its major importance to academia, industry, and government.  Many conferences have a big data component, e.g., sessions that offer papers on big data, but none seemed to offer the same focus as proposed for this minitrack. We expect the competition to get more intense in succeeding years, so we are trying to establish this minitrack as a preferred venue for Big Data papers.  Marketing Plan We email a Call for Papers to a mailing list of over 200 practitioners, authors, etc. who have submitted or attended our minitracks and tutorials. In addition, we submit the CFP to various professional societies, university programs with Big Data, Data Analytics, Data Science, and similar types of programs. We continually enhance our mailing list each year through contacts and other means.  Target Journals for Paper Publication: There are several journals and professional society we could target for special issues comprised of papers arising from this minitrack.  IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (for parallel analytics) IEEE Proceedings (perhaps a special issue?) IEEE Transactions on Services Computing IEEE Systems Journal IEEE Computer  INFORMS Information Systems Research INFORMS Management Information Systems Quarterly  INFORMS Management Science INFORMS Organization Science INFORMS Operations Research  INFORMS Decision Analysis INFORMS Analytics  Journal of Management Information Systems Data Warehouse Institute Business Intelligence Journal ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data Communications of the ACM ACM Computing Surveys (for survey papers on specific topics)  We will attempt to line up at least one special issue of a relevant IEEE journal if the accepted papers merit archival publication.  To further promote Big Data, the co-chairs and a colleague, Dr. William Money, co-authored a book entitled Obtaining Value from Big Data for Service Delivery, which was published in January 2016 by Business Expert Press (BEP).

In recent years we have co-chaired several HICSS mini-tracks on  topics related to the RFID, Internet of Things (IoT), wearable smart devices, and the Internet of  Everything. In HICSS-56 (2023) we would like to revise our topic and launch a new mini-track in  the rising field of “Decision Analytics Using Blockchain Smart Contracts”. Today, distributed  ledger  technologies  (DLTs)  using  blockchains  and  smart  contracts  have  the  potential  to  revolutionize how commerce is conducted in the coming decade. There is a growing consensus  that blockchains with smart contracts will enable new types of services and products that don’t  require  the  mediation  of  trusted-third  parties.    Instead,  trust  and  decision  making  will  be  programmed directly on blockchains such as Ethereum and Hyperledger. We predict that our new  track could receive many submissions in this emerging area.     This mini-track will address how smart contracts programmed on blockchain platforms are being  used to automate decision analytics to provide new types of services. Smart contracts can be used  to track changes and automate decision making in supply chain systems, ledgers recording  ownership transfers, and governance in decentralized autonomous organizations.  The rapid  development of blockchain technology and smart contracts in the last ten years has fueled a  dramatic increase in commerce in the crypto space.  Financial services, supply chain systems,  healthcare  delivery,  manufacturing  systems,  and  agriculture  are  all  being  impacted  by  the  emergence of distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) that are enabled with smart contracts.  Smart  contracts are executable code that run on blockchains such as Ethereum or Hyperledger to enable,  monitor, and execute transactions and agreements between parties without the use of traditional  trusted-third parties.  These smart contracts essentially automate the decision analytics required  for commerce to be conducted between two or more parties.  If blockchain commerce is to become  widespread it is important to understand the characteristics and best practices needed for effective  and efficient smart contracts.      Therefore, for this coming HICSS-56 we are proposing a half-day mini-track that addresses issues  on smart contract usage, best practices, and impacts. The co-chairs for this proposal have been  involved in HICSS for over two decades and have been editors for special journal issues on a  number of topics associated to the proposed theme. We believe our contacts in business analytics,  IoT, RFID, the business value of IT, and blockchain will be beneficial in building a critical mass  of submissions for this mini-track. You can find the detailed call for papers draft below, which we  will be sending to select individuals we know who are engaged in business analytics research  following acceptance of our mini-track proposal.

Description (to be included in the HICSS-56 Advance Program Announcement)    A. Technical Area: Decision Analytics Using Blockchain Smart Contracts. This mini-track  will address how smart contracts programmed on blockchain platforms are being used to automate  decision analytics to provide new types of services. Smart contracts can be used to track changes  and automate decision making in supply chain systems, ledgers recording ownership transfers, and  governance in decentralized autonomous organizations.  The rapid development of blockchain  technology and smart contracts in the last ten years has fueled a dramatic increase in commerce in  the crypto space.  Financial services, supply chain systems, healthcare delivery, manufacturing  systems, and agriculture are all being impacted by the emergence of distributed ledger technologies  (DLTs) that are enabled with smart contracts.  Smart contracts are executable code that run on  blockchains such as Ethereum or Hyperledger to enable, monitor, and execute transactions and  agreements between parties without the use of traditional trusted-third parties.  These smart  contracts essentially automate the decision analytics required for commerce to be conducted  between two or more parties.  If blockchain commerce is to become widespread it is important to  understand the characteristics and best practices needed for effective and efficient smart contracts.      We encourage authors to share new and interesting theoretical and methodological perspectives  on topics relevant to both academic researchers and practitioners.  We welcome work-in-progress  that examines existing and extended theory using smart contracts.  We give special consideration  to  research submissions  when the  author(s) commit to  include an industry  partner in  their  presentation.  We welcome research that reflects a range of current research methods including  case studies, analytical models, conceptual studies, econometrics, and frameworks.    B. Topics. The following areas are suggestive of the range of topics that are considered suitable:     Case studies on supply chains using blockchains and smart contracts    Blockchain utilization to enhance IoT-enabled services    Business models for services using blockchains and smart contracts    Frameworks on how smart contracts function in a legal setting    The role of blockchains and smart contracts in smart services    The role and integration of oracles into blockchain systems    Technical evolution including best practices for writing and testing smart contracts    Application of service science and service-dominant logic to smart contracts    Integrating blockchains and smart contracts to other larger systems    Cryptoeconomics and smart contracts  2      Frameworks on measuring the value of blockchains and smart contracts     Designing, planning, building and managing smart contracts    Safeguarding security and privacy using smart contracts    C. Marketing Plan and Expectations.  We will be sending our call for papers to select individuals  we know who are engaged in business analytics and blockchain research. In addition, we will post  the call for papers announcement on AIS and INFORMS listserv groups.    We expect to receive between 10 and 12 submissions for this mini-track and expect to accept five  or six for the two mini-track sessions.  Under the mini-track format, we hope to continue to build  synergy for this area of research and to have approximately 35 to 40 people in attendance.  We  hope to build a community of researchers and practitioners in this area and continue this mini- track into the future.     3. Bio Sketches.

It is important for researchers to continue to move systems closer to guarantees of security, but it is also essential to create techniques to adaptively defend against an attacker who circumvents the current security or has insider knowledge of system properties or security practices. Deception for cyber defense works towards that goal—to rebalance the asymmetric nature of computer defense by increasing attacker workload and risk while decreasing that of the defender.  Cyber deception is one defensive technique that considers the human component of a cyber attack. Deception holds promise as a successful tactic for making an attacker’s job harder because it does more than just block access: it can also cause the attacker to waste both time and effort. Moreover, deception can be used by a defender to impart an incorrect belief in the attacker, and effects on the decision-making process can go beyond any static defense. Understanding the human cognition and behavior of both the cyber defender and cyber attacker is a critical component of cybersecurity. Cyberpsychology research advances the science of human behavior and decision making in cyberspace to understand, anticipate, and influence attacker behavior. It also seeks to ensure scientific rigor and quantify the effectiveness of our defensive methods. In the cyber world, an attacker only knows what is perceived through observation of the target network. The intruder is often thousands of miles away from the network to which he or she is attempting to gain entry. Unfortunately, modern networks and systems often unintentionally provide more information to an attacker than defenders would like. However, the network owner also has the opportunity to reveal information he or she desires the attacker to know—including deceptive information. Because network information is often complex and incomplete, it provides a natural environment in which to embed deception since, in chaos, there is opportunity. Deception, and other cyberpsychology techniques, can alter the mindset, confidence, and decision-making process of an attacker, which can have more significant effects than traditional defenses. Furthermore, using deception for defensive purposes gives the defender at least partial control of what an attacker knows, which can provide opportunities for strategic interaction with an attacker.  Authorized users of systems and networks, or masqueraders of these users, may act as attackers. These insiders can leak sensitive information deliberately or accidentally. Detecting and thwarting these attacks is more difficult than dealing with external attackers because the users are often authorized to access the information they leak, or the systems and networks the data is on. As a defensive technique, deception in this context must take into account the psychology of the attacker and the organizational, political, and societal environments in which the attack occurs. These research efforts require an interdisciplinary approach and the mini-track is soliciting papers across multiple disciplines. It is essential to understand attacker and defender cognition and behavior to effectively and strategically induce cognitive biases and increase cognitive load, making our systems more difficult to attack.   Topics of interest include (but are not limited to): Science of Deception (e.g., evaluation techniques, deception frameworks applied to cyber); Practice of Cyber Deception (e.g., case studies, deception technology, deception detection); Understanding/influencing the cyber adversary (e.g., adversary emulation, measures of effectiveness, decision analytics for cyber operators); Psychological and social-cultural adversarial mental models that can be used to estimate and predict adversarial mental states and decision processes; Cognitive Modeling of cyber tasks; Adversary observation/learning schemes through both active multi-level “honey bait” systems and passive watching, in conjunction with active learning and reasoning to deal with partial information and uncertainties; Oppositional Human Factors to induce cognitive biases and increase cognitive load for cyber attackers; Metrics for quantifying deception effectiveness in driving adversary mental state and in determining optimized deception information composition and projection; Experimental Design, approaches, and results; Theoretical formulation for a one-shot or multiple rounds of attacker/defender interaction models; Identification of social/cultural factors in mental state estimation and decision manipulation process; Cyber maneuver and adaptive defenses; Cyber defense teaming; Protecting our autonomous systems from being deceived; Policy hurdles, solutions, and case studies in adoption of cyber deception and similar technologies; Predicting, understanding and protecting against insider threats; Analyzing the effects of insider attacks; Human factors and the insider threat problem; Examining the causes of an insider threat from a behavioral science perspective; Measuring the effectiveness of mitigation technologies and methodologies; and Models and algorithms for decision analytics for autonomous or adaptive cyber defense.    Justification Before the Cyber Deception for Defense minitrack at HICSS-53, there was no existing academic conference with proceedings that specifically calls for papers on cyber deception (and prior to HICSS-54 none specific to cyberpsychology for defense). The program chairs had previously organized their own independent workshop on cyber deception, cyber psychology, and insider threat detection, and are well known in that community. A number of notable experts from academia, industry, government, and funding agencies regularly attend these events. The cyber deception and cyber psychology community needs to join with a conference to have one repeating location where researchers can gather to share and discuss results. The outcome of the first mintrack was as expected, with a record-breaking number of submissions for an inaugural minitrack (within Digital Government) and receipt of the HICSS best paper award. HICSS continues to be a good candidate because its multi-disciplinary nature aligns with broad range of disciplines that perform research in cyber deception.  Marketing Plan The co-chairs have a number of approaches to encourage participation in this proposed mini-track. This relies on our extensive, international-level networks to encourage Participation and submissions from our academic, government, and industry contacts. In addition to the participant list from our independent cyber deception workshop run in past years, we can further leverage our specific knowledge of researchers and sponsors of research specifically focused on cyber deception.

This enables  them to be globally networked and to provide intelligent functions linking digital and physical  world. Such products can also be referred to as cyber-physical systems or smart products.  They are a valuable asset to improve service efficiency and to drive service innovation. But,  as of today, manufacturing companies still struggle to establish data-driven service systems  based on cyber-physical systems.   These  kinds  of  service  systems  differ  strongly  from  the  established  businesses  in  manufacturing – from the service businesses as well as the product businesses. Manufacturing  companies need new  tools and  approaches  to  create  and manage  data-driven  service  systems. Furthermore, new processes, structures, and competences are needed to provide  them. Therefore a transformation of the whole business is necessary. Recognizing these  challenges, this minitrack aims to explore insights on multiple facets of service systems in  manufacturing, that are built around intelligent, technical systems and integrate their data.  Topics may span applied, empirical, design science and conceptual research.  Typical themes that are expected for contributions to the minitrack include (but are not limited  to):  •  Considerations regarding strategic position, competences, and/or organizational structures  of manufacturing firms  •  Ideation and portfolio management  •  Conceptual design of service systems (e.g., modelling languages, architectures etc.)  •  Business models for smart services, digital services and/or digital product-service-systems  (e.g., business model patterns, archetypes, revenue models etc.)  •  Organizational transformation (e.g., management of change processes, business process  reengineering, business model innovation)  •  Performance assessment of digital services in manufacturing  •  Realized data-driven service systems and their implications for theory  •  Studies on the actual state of the art in practice, associated challenges, and future research  needs      Page 1 of 3                          Marketing plan: We will prepare a high-quality call for paper (PDF) for our minitrack and  distribute it via our research network. This includes the excellence cluster intelligent technical  systems owl, the community of the symposium for foresight and technologyplanning (SVT),  our national and international research partners, and internet portals like research gate.

The following three years had this focus but with specifications at HICSS-37 and HICSS-38: Core business technology and intelligent support. Then at HICSS-39 the mini-track was refocused to better catch the challenges of mobile commerce, now with the name Mobile Value Service, as mobile value services represent key challenges in mobile commerce. In 2019 the theme was again changed to capture the developments in digital technology and the mini track was renamed Digital Mobile Services for Everyday Life. As we all know, everyday life changed dramatically in March 2020 with the Covid-19 pandemonium; what was not expected is that it facilitated a digital leap, also in the deployment and use of mobile services.  During the last 30 years, the advancements of digital technologies have enhanced our lives in a myriad of ways. Services deploying various types of mobile and other digital technologies are developed predominantly first to consumer markets all over the world to improve the quality of consumers’ everyday life. The worldwide number of mobile subscriptions alone - over 8.6 billion - means that there is more than one subscription per each adult.   We assume that the vast community of mobile and other digital technologies and services users will continue to generate innovations and value from the deployment of these technologies, which will be visible in research themes, methods, applications, and case studies of the mini track.   The ongoing implementation of 5G networks and Internet of Things (IoT) devices will enable a range of new services and business cases transforming our everyday life from business activities to leisure time. In relation to legacy information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT), smartphones and other mobile devices are used not only to access networks, information systems and data storages but also to augment them with innovative mobile applications.   Our understanding of business models, platforms and their governance, ecosystems, privacy and the value creation mechanisms of digital mobile services has not grown fast enough to fully cover the influences of all new technological developments. Further knowledge and theory building are needed to establish sound dynamic models over the phenomena, to derive theoretical explanations, or to provide solid guidance to the users, developers, and regulators of digital services.   On the other hand, it is vital to also advance our understanding of the individual technology user; the acceptance, adoption, use and sustained use of technology within the sphere of everyday life. Within this area, there is also a necessity to encourage research involving less studied consumer groups, such as age groups above and beyond working age, users of assistive technologies, users with disabilities, technology non-users and minorities.   Research evidence on how older adults (now 18-22% of the population in most EU countries) use and perceive technology is varied. Older adults as a market are growing in most developed countries, thus there is a need to update our knowledge about this market segment. Most western societies are turning to digitalization to manage costs of public services; thus, it becomes highly important to keep the aging population in sufficiently good shape to carry out everyday tasks. Physical wellness is key and studies show that physical exercise is something of a corner stone for getting and sustaining a good quality life in senior years.   Some consensus reports that regular and systematic physical activities (PAs) can serve as preventive health care. The Copenhagen Consensus statement (2019): (i) “being physically active is a key factor in maintaining health …” (ii) “physically active older adults, compared with older inactive adults, show benefits in terms of physical and cognitive function …” (iii) “physical inactivity in older adults is associated with a trajectory towards disease and increased risk of premature all-cause mortality …”. Digital wellness services implemented with mobile technology is instrumental for getting preventive health routines for older adults and are now generating growing research contributions.  We encourage methodological diversity and novel research approaches and models to study this multifaceted phenomenon. For example, user and service usage data, or usage pattern sequences can be used e.g., for customer profiling, marketing and to develop new value-adding services but it also gives researchers an objective view on individuals’ technology usage and the means to investigate usage patterns, rhythms, and configurations as well as the possibility to discover unexpected phenomena. Qualitative work can yield rich insights into individuals’ motivations and decision making. Creative, well-designed research, regardless of the chosen method, is needed to achieve the goal of the mini track since its very start in 2002: to offer research contributions that open new perspectives and insights for the better deployment and use of mobile and other digital technologies, services, and applications.  In this mini track, we have also followed the development of digital payment services offered to consumers - especially mobile payments – that are used to pay for consumers’ everyday life purchases. Mobile payments and mobile banking, fintech included, continue to be active research streams with lots of unsolved research questions. More recently, virtual tokens, central bank virtual currencies (CBVC) and other virtual currencies have emerged as payment alternatives for everyday purchases of digital and other services. Research on contemporary mobile and virtual payment services, their platforms and ecosystems, comparisons between developed and emerging countries’ use of mobile and virtual payments, as well as papers on other mobile and virtual payment issues are warmly welcome.   It appears that research will have to tackle an increasing number of challenges and we invite research contributions that open up new and innovative perspectives and thus offer insight for a better understanding on mobile and other digital services in any area of everyday life. The research may focus on the design, implementation, usage, regulation and/or evaluation of digital technologies, services and applications.    Relevant topics for this mini track include (but are not limited to):  Digital Mobile Services in a business/organizational setting Design, development, implementation and/or continued use of business apps, integration with business platforms and architectures Mobile and other digital business apps for commerce, marketing and business operations Mobile services used to augment business applications, for example status, location or flow of goods, money or data Digital Mobile Services in consumer settings Consumer initiated and co-created digital services, consumer feedback Usage patterns of digital technologies, services, and applications  Mobile payments, virtual payments, mobile banking, comparisons of traditional mobile payment services with cryptocurrency/virtual currency payment services Competition of mobile and virtual payment platforms for consumer, merchant, identity service provider and other stakeholder attention Business architectures of mobile and virtual payment services, platforms, recognition and other technologies, mobile use of virtual currencies and tokens Digital services for young elderly (60 +) Drivers for acceptance and use of digital services Self-efficacy and forming of daily routines for physical activities Wearable devices and digital coaching Understanding wearable device usage Digital coaching apps   Sports watches as drivers of systematic physical activities Integrated location-based services Adoption, acceptance, and diffusion of digital services     Marketing plan: We will distribute the call for papers to those who attended our mini-track in 2022, as well as those from previous years, members of the IS-community in Europe as well as all our colleagues globally. We will also send invitations to known mobile payment researchers, most of whom we know and/or have met in person.

Box 35 FIN-40014 University of Jyväskylä Finland tuure@tuunanen.fi   Primary contact: Tuure Tuunanen Central Theme: The purpose of the minitrack is to attract research on the innovation, design, development, management, and use of digital services and the digitalization of services. The key drivers in this area of research are the multiplying technological opportunities for digital services, such as ubiquitous connectivity, artificial intelligence, wearable devices, cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things (IoT), virtual/augmented reality, web3, and so on. The minitrack provides a discussion forum for researchers interested theoretical and practical problems related to such services .  In a broad sense, digital services can be defined as systems that enable value co-creation and limit value co-destruction through the development and implementation of ICT enabled processes that integrate system value propositions with customer value drivers . Such services meld the worlds of bits and atoms and promise to transform many sectors like the media industries before them. They draw on different technologies such as sensors, real-time analytics of data, augmented and virtual realities, computer hardware, software, and human and system actors. Such technologies form a service platform where different actors  assemble the service together, in situ, as argued by Grönroos . As a result, the embedded systems of today and the Internet-of-things of tomorrow are the precursors for the upcoming era of cybernized services . Examples of such services are, e.g., biomedical and healthcare systems such as telerobotic surgery, (semi)autonomous vehicles and intelligent highways, augmented human capabilities with body net sensors and virtual reality, and intelligent machines.  Furthermore, there are substantial opportunities for ICT and digitalization driven service innovation in industrial and business-to-business settings. These opportunities exist particularly in manufacturing in which innovation activities increase the digitization of products and production processes. We see that the global awareness of the power of the manufacturing industry will be linked to horizontal cyber-physical systems that enable value co-creation and co-destruction in the networked business environment. The cyber-aspects of such systems are ICT infrastructure, computer hardware, software, and different kind of sensors and actors. These components turn cyber-physical systems into platforms for designing and operating service. The data on products and processes gained through networked cybernized services and the ability to act on this data through control systems and actors enables novel ways of co-creating service in industrial contexts.  This emerging area of research raises interesting questions . For example, traditional development approaches focus on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of organizational processes. The design of such services may, however, require an emphasis on the socio-psychological aspects, such as the value-in-use and user/consumer/co-creator experiences. Digital services create novel ways of engaging customers and other actors in service ecosystems, raising the question of effective patterns of such digital actor engagement . Moreover, digital services facilitate data-driven and analytics-based service design and development, particularly if the service is linked to the physical world through sensors and/or people’s interactions. Discussion Topics: The shift of consumer and enterprise personnel from users to co-creators and co-destructors of value, calls for a significant re-appraisal of our current design and development approaches. Relevant topics for this minitrack include (but are not limited to):  Digital and ICT enabled services, industrial services, mobile services, and consumer information services and systems Discovery, fuzzy-front end, and innovation processes  Continuous and experimental service design, and development processes and methodologies Analytics supported service design and development Design and evaluation of novel digital services Service ecosystems, platforms and novel architectures  Consumer and enterprise user aspects, novel forms of actor engagement Service ecosystems and effective patterns of actor engagement in digital services Hedonic ICT enabled services  Socio-psychological aspects of ICT enabled service use Understanding social and cultural contexts  Cyber-Physical and IoT enabled services, Cybernized Services: Cyber-Physical and IoT enabled services from different disciplinary perspectives, such as, information systems, operations research, software engineering, service science, and service research Service innovation based on Cyber-Physical and IoT enabled services  Cyber-Physical and IoT service ecosystems, platforms and novel architecture  Theoretical aspects of Cyber-Physical and IoT enabled services research Cyber-Physical and IoT enabled services as artifacts Use and adoption of Cyber-Physical and IoT enabled services  Artificial-intelligence enabled services: Service Robots and Service Robot enabled services Services enabled by natural language assistants Human-machine interaction in AI-enabled services Operational aspects of AI-enabled services, e.g. monitoring and support Ethical and regulatory considerations in designing AI-enabled services New technology enabled services, e.g. services using smart television, smart watches, wearables, mobile devices and phones or other technologies like augmented/virtual reality, blockchain, IoT etc.  Web3 enabled services: New decentralized service innovations Service automation with Web3 technologies Topics Covered in earlier HICSS and Other Conferences and Publications Last year, the minitrack successfully attracted six accepted papers, leading to two lively and well-attended session, including some social media buzz about the sessions. The minitrack continues also to build on a community from previous minitracks on the design and development of mobile consumer and enterprise services. Recent special issues on digital services in leading journals testify about the growing interest in the area: MIS Quarterly’s special issue on Service Innovation in the Digital Age, J. of Service Research’s special issue on ICT enabled services , and J. of Management Information Systems special issue on IS in services . The proposed minitrack aims to build on these research communities. Lastly, it should be emphasized that the minitrack is broad in the sense that the covers the service lifecycle from innovation to development. However, at the same time, it strives to avoid overlap with other mini-tracks by not explicitly citing digital and digitalized services related topics such as supply-chains, e-government, outsourcing and offshoring, e-learning, or service quality.

This is not limited to the fact that digital games have become a pervasive part of our lives, but  perhaps most prominently with the fact that activities, systems and services that are not traditionally perceived  as game-like are becoming either intentionally or emergently gameful (5; 7; 11; 14; 15).  Gamification refers to a “process of transforming any activity, system, service, product or organizational  structure into one which affords positive experiences, skills and practices similar to those afforded by games, and  is often referred to as the gameful experience. This is commonly but optionally done with an intention to facilitate  changes in behaviours or cognitive processes. As the main inspirations of gamification are games and play,  gamification is commonly pursued by employing game design” (7).  Gamification has become an umbrella concept that, to varying degrees, includes and encompasses other related  technological developments such as serious games (3), game-based learning (13; 27), exergames & quantified- self (9; 10; 24), games with a purpose/human-based computation games (18; 31), and persuasive technology  (23).  Secondly, gamification also manifests in a gradual, albeit unintentional, cultural, organizational and societal  transformation stemming from the increased pervasive engagement with games, gameful interactions (7), game  communities (20) and player practices. For example, recently we have witnessed the popular emergence of  augmented reality games (17; 18) and virtual reality technologies (2; 32) that enable a more seamless integration  of games into our physical reality. Case in point are urban spaces that are increasingly becoming playgrounds  for different games and -play activities. While location-based games such as Pokémon Go (1) were able to attract  millions of players, concepts such as Playable Cities (22) and Urban Gamification (29;19) highlight the large-scale  changes that games are bringing about in the smart cities of the future. Moreover, the media ecosystem has  also experienced a degree of ludic transformation: with user generated content becoming an important  competitor for large media corporations. This transformation has led to the development of several emerging  phenomena such as the Youtube and modding cultures (26; 30), esports (8; 28), or the ‘metaverse’ (4), that have  penetrated the cultural membrane allowing games to seep into domains hitherto dominated by traditional  media.   We encourage a wide range of submissions from any disciplinary backgrounds: empirical and conceptual  research papers, case studies, and reviews.  Authors of accepted papers have the option to fast-track extended versions of their HICSS  papers to  Internet Research or AIS Transactions on Human-Computer Interaction.

Stafford  Minitrack Chair  CIS Department  Louisiana Tech University   stafford@latech.edu    To be included in the broad Knowledge Innovation and Entrepreneurial Systems Track, this proposed  minitrack seeks to recruit papers that demonstrate practical and compelling techniques for the  presentation of Grounded Theories to readers and audiences. A part of the qualitative knowledge  management system that is GTM is the coding of qualitative data; much of this occurs implicitly, initially,  in the mind of the researcher interacting with subjects during interviews. However, even when using  available software assistance technologies, what Saldaña  (2013) characterizes as CAQDAS (Computer  Aided Qualitive Data Analysis Software), it still remains difficult to convey the meaning of an emergent  mid-range theory arising from GTM studies without a good way to telegraphically and pictorially  demonstrate key aspects of the theory and its operational mechanisms.     This requires good visualization. Visualizing emerging theory is a part of most informed GTM  approached. Miles et al.  (1991) call the concept of visual depictions of theoretical concepts “modeling,”  while Anselm Strauss (1987) refers to the notion as visual operationalization. Theoretical matrices (Miles  and Huberman, 1991), also visual in nature, show the evolution of the inductive coding process from  open codes through thematic selective codes to theoretical coding levels (e.g., Glaser, 1978) in  dendrogram-like visual arrays of semantic constructions.     This minitrack seeks to provide guidance for GTM researchers on the mechanism of visual  representation of their inductive theorizing, with an eye toward making the process vastly more  discernable and accessible by readers of research. Papers with a specific methodological demonstration  of the visualization process are as welcome as papers that induce and explain specific theories, using  visual metaphors and representations.     The fast-track venues for selected papers considered to make strong contributions will be The DATA  BASE for Advances in Information Systems and Journal of the AIS.

Led by Maarit Palo, IBM Research, Global University Programs Northern Europe, Dr. Taina Eriksson, Research Director, University of Turku, Dean Professor Adam Smale, University of Vaasa, and Dr. Jim Spohrer, ISSIP.  HICSS 56 – 2023  This mini-track is offered at HICSS 56 for inclusion in the Decision Analytics and Service Science Track as Innovative applications of technologies in industry-university collaboration to prepare for the future of work  Description of minitrack:  The purpose of this mini-track is to invite studies of applications of technologies (such as AI and analytics) in the domain of industry-university collaboration for meeting emerging requirements of future work and upskilling the workforce.   The future of work is a widely debated topic, and there appears to be agreement that the requirements for workers will change even dramatically. Work changes in complex ways as there are developments in: the contents of work, task-specific skills, meta-skills, work environments and work modes (Unkila, 2021). The change is more profound than the incremental societal changes we have witnessed during past decades.   There will be an increasing need for T-shaped upskilling - with depth and breadth - with lifelong learning plans or individual learning plans from high school through multiple jobs and careers in the AI and Digital era.  Most future jobs will be in the knowledge/tech-intensive service sector of the economy, as well as entrepreneurship for next generation local green agriculture, manufacturing, and traditional service sector professions and shops, including healthcare, government, transportation, communications, entertainment & hospitality, finance, investing, and real-estate, (Moghaddam, Demirkan, Spohrer 2018; Gardner, Marietta 2020)  In this era of uncertainty, complexity and disruptive changes, companies need to discover new ways of ensuring that they have the skills and capabilities to thrive. The Future of Jobs Report 2020 highlights that skills gap continues to be a challenge, since the in-demand skills are changing across nearly all jobs. According to the report, companies estimate that around 40% of workers need reskilling or upskilling of up to six months. In fact, there is a need for continuous upskilling and reskilling.   On the other hand, most higher education institutions need to solve how to provide students with the necessary skills based on existing faculty competences and budget constraints that limit possibilities to invest in technology infrastructure. There is thus a need within higher education to turn to innovative, quick and scalable solutions to close the skills gap across a variety of curricula.   Thus, there are considerable challenges to be solved in collaboration between industry and the academia. Moreover, there is certainly underutilized potential in industry-university collaboration for upskilling and reskilling. Building on existing collaboration models, novel technology applications offer possibilities for leveraging this potential. One question is also how technology will transform the role of scholars (researchers) and educators (faculty), and the need for more industry collaboration and both side learning to invest in the future of learning and work collaboratively (Spohrer, Maglio, Vargo, Warg 2022, forthcoming).  We are looking for studies on existing solutions in the aforementioned domains and the potential of applying technologies for continuous learning through industry-university collaboration.   We encourage papers that report on lessons learned, on topics which include, but are not limited to, the following:  Novel solutions (AI, analytics, digital platforms) in university-industry collaboration for upskilling Addressing different challenges with university and industry collaboration Applying AI, BI and analytics in education in innovative and novel ways; with particular focus on university-industry collaboration Use case examples where universities and industry have worked together for education impact and digital transformation How knowledge and skill development can be formally recognised among education institutions and employers amidst the rapidly expanding area of microcredentials Innovative use of enabling technologies in upskilling the workforce How university can support industry (e.g. in the context of continuous education in non-technology-based organisations) closing the skills gap, as well as how industry can support university (e.g. technical expertise, platforms, tools and co-creation of curricula) in closing the skills gap  Sophisticated metrics and ROI examples relevant in developing industry-university collaboration Next generation of strategic innovative partnerships with universities and industry   Potential contributors include, but are not limited to:  Teachers who are working with technology firms or individual experts in the design of their course/programme curricula Technology experts from industry that are co-creating curricula with teachers in higher education Specialists in continuous education that are developing microcredentials around analytics skills Deans/Rectors with responsibility for education that have created strategic partnerships with industry    Marketing Plan We plan to solicit and promote papers in many ways in IBM internal and external global communication channels, University of Turku communication channels, and University of Vaasa communication channels. The mini-track will be promoted among faculty members in universities worldwide via IBM Global University Program channels and as well as via IBM Research channels. We will also use the ISSIP newsletter and social media. The universities of Turku and Vaasa will share the call for papers in their social media channels that reach researchers. In addition, the universities’ researchers are engaged in sharing the call for papers in their channels to achieve broad coverage and attract submissions from diverse researchers.

Description of a minitrack The use of technology to support students learning has become an increasingly prominent feature of educational settings in general. The use of learning management systems to support educational settings is not new, but the vast amount of data being gathered through both students’ and teachers’ use of them, is however understudied. Because of the vast amounts of data that is now being generated and gathered through the use of learning platforms within educational settings, the learning behavior of students, derived from the data, can now be analyzed in new ways. Analyzing the learning behaviors of students can then be used to improve teaching practices.   The mini-track is interested in papers that take on analyzing teaching and learning behaviors through learning management systems (or learning platforms) through data-driven approaches. The interest extends to papers that shed light on the type of data that is required to improve teaching and learning in different levels of education and how data can be used to better understand, and improve, the educational environment. The interest thereby extends to papers discussing different approaches in data analytics (for instance by opening up the box of how machine learning techniques to discover relevant factors that can be used to improve teaching and learning and discussing the outcome) as well as to papers discussing qualitative research on teaching and learning, where data is used to support these processes. The interest is therefore not merely in big data and grand projects but also extends to the use of small data, that can support teaching or learning. The papers can take the point of departure from the teacher’s side, or from the student’s perspective, or even be written from the intersection between the teachers’ and the students’ practices.   We welcome papers that reflect on, and relate to, learning analytics and datafication in educational settings alongside papers that reflect on learning platforms, teaching practices, learning practices, student profiling, use of third-party applications (for instance for lecture capture) to support education, and everything from small apps to large systems and infrastructures in educational contexts that generate data that can be analyzed and used to impact educational outcomes. We encourage papers based on both qualitative and quantitative methods and on machine learning approaches, as well as empirical, methodological, and theoretical papers that inspire a dialog with the growing literature on learning analytics and datafication of educational settings. The interest extends to all educational levels where the partnership between students and teachers is important.    Mini-track chairs Sara Willermark, assistant professor in informatics, School of Business, Economics & IT, University West, Sweden (), Anna Sigridur Islind, assistant professor in informatics, School of Computer Science, Reykjavik University, Iceland () Maria Oskarsdottir, assistant professor in informatics, School of Computer Science, Reykjavik University, Iceland (), Galina Deeva, Faculty of Economics & Business, KU Leuven, Belgium ().      Marketing plan We plan to announce the track on our local lists (in three countries), on the Scandinavian lists for IS research, as well as in our engagements (internationally) through our separate research projects.  In addition, we will send out calls to three national graduate schools that focus on education technology.

Our goals are two-fold:   Create a forum for industry colleagues to share their insights such that they can be incorporated into future teaching and research. This is a practical step in the process to upskill our workforce. Engage industry and academic colleagues to find collaboration opportunities.  Some people call the current wave of transformation “digital transformation.” We call it “service transformation enabled by digital technologies.” The goal of this minitrack is to explore applications of science and technology to real-world innovations through practitioner reports, case studies, best practice examples, tutorials, challenges, issues, opportunities, tools, techniques, and methodologies of emerging digital technologies. In many cases, practice is ahead of academic research contributions.   Highlights:  To reduce the divide between theory and practice, we create a venue for practitioners to share real-world applications of science and technology Presenters: Practitioner(s) (one of the co-authors needs to be a practitioner) Paper: short, 3-page executive summary Format: IEEE Computer Society Format  Peer-reviewed Accepted and presented papers will be published in the HICSS proceedings () and considered for on-going publication in one of the Business Expert Press Book Series ""Collaborative Intelligence: People, AI, and the Future of Work"" or ""Service Systems and Innovations in Business and Society.""  Advanced technical capabilities are revolutionizing business activities, processes, and business models. The overall goal of any transformation, including service transformation, is to increase the productivity and creativity (decision making, connectivity, innovation, and augmentation) of individuals and organizations.   Practitioner research offers more directly applicable results and an opportunity to focus academic attention and teaching where it is needed most. This is aligned with the ideals promoted by the  (RRBM), , and  and others. By offering a venue to highlight practice-based innovation, we hope to increase the pace of discovery and application overall. Practitioner research serves as a two-way bridge between academic research and the organizations on the front lines. We need to link robust research findings to practitioner experiences across management, organizational contexts, architecture, and design related to applications of science and technology.

There is increasing realization that ML models, in  addition to making predictions, reveal information about relationships between domain data  items, commonly referred to as interpretability of the model. A similar situation is occurring in  the artificial intelligence (AI) scientific community, which has concentrated on explainable AI  (XAI) along the dimensions of algorithmic interpretability, explainability, transparency, and  accountability of algorithmic judgments. ML approaches may be classified as white-box or  black-box; while white-box techniques like rule learners and inductive logic programming  provide explicit models that are intrinsically interpretable, black-box techniques, such as (deep)  neural networks, provide opaque models. With the growing use of ML, there have been  significant social concerns about implementing black-box models for decisions requiring the  explanation of domain relationships. The ability to express information obtained from ML  models in human-comprehensible language -aka interpretability- has sparked considerable  attention in academics and industry. These interpretations have found applications in healthcare,  transportation, finance, education, policymaking, criminal justice, etc. As it evolves, one aim in  ML is the development of interpretable techniques and models that explain themselves and their  output.   This minitrack invites papers on advancements in interpretable ML from the modeling and  learning perspectives. We are looking for high-quality, original articles presenting work on the  following (not exhaustive) topics:  •  Probabilistic graphical model applications  •  Rule learning for interpretable machine learning  •  Interpretation of black-box models  •  Interpretability in reinforcement learning  •  Interpretable supervised and unsupervised models  •  Interpretation of neural networks and ensemble-based methods  •  Interpretations of random forests and other ensemble models  •  Causality of machine learning models  •  Novel applications requiring interpretability  •  Methodologies for measuring interpretability of machine learning models  •  Interpretability-accuracy trade-off and its benchmarks    Journals for fast-track opportunities: Currently working on a proposal for a special issue on  the Annals of Operations Research journal.

Currently, he and his  team are actively working on different ML & AI solutions within industrial services, sales  forecasting, production lines or even creativity. Niklas is internationally collaborating with the  University of Auckland and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.    Prof. Dr. Gerhard Satzger   is Director of the Karlsruhe Service Research Institute (KSRI), an “industry-on-campus”  initiative focused on innovation via digital services, and the Institute of Information Systems  and Marketing (IISM) at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). His research interests  are the use of data and artificial intelligence to develop and transform novel services and  service business models. Before joining KSRI, he has gathered multi-year industry  experience in various national and international roles within IBM, among others as head of  their European Chief Analytics Office and as CFO of IBM’s technology services business in  Central Europe. He has obtained a formal postdoctoral lecturer qualification from the  University of Augsburg, a Ph.D. in Information Systems from the University of Giessen and  an MBA from Oregon State University/USA, after graduating from the University of Karlsruhe  with a degree in Industrial Engineering and Management.

This is a recently  evolving, distinct area of research that holds the potential to significantly improve service  providers’ ability to better utilize the data accruing daily in the service systems they are involved  in. This will inter alia allow organizations to 1) make better use of their deployable resources,  2) support strategic decision-making and offer more customer-friendly service contracts, 3) use  customer and systems information to create new service offerings and business models (e.g.  predictive maintenance services), and 4) make more sense of their existing knowledge and  enable sustainable learning over several years of service provision.  The themes of this minitrack are congruent with the “Decision Analytics, Mobile Services and  Service Science” track’s dimensions “Analytics” and “Service Science”, in exploring the use of  analytical techniques and decision support to enhance the outcomes of provider-customer  service systems. Additionally, the proposed minitrack encourages the presentation work that  touches upon the remaining dimension “Mobile Services”, which constitute a main source of  the ever-increasing amount of service-related data, one of the drivers of the fast-growing  importance of the service analytics field.  Publicity for the proposed minitrack will be created through a combination of vehicles: 1) It will  be advertised on our research institute’s web presence, 2) It will be advertised and explained  in the course of events hosted at our research institute with international audience, including  the annual “Service Summit” at Karlsruhe, 3) We will directly contact notable Professors and  departments in the areas of service science and operations research, and professional service  research communities (through Jim Spohrer, IBM) to solicit contributions to the minitrack and  to raise awareness of its scientific relevance.      Karlsruhe Service Research Institute (KSRI) endorses my involvement in HICSS-56 as a  minitrack chair and will pay for my travel expenses and registration cost to attend the  conference.      3 "

Description of the minitrack  We  plan  to  continue  to  organize  this  minitrack  to  bring  together  researchers  and  practitioners working in the field of service science, the interdisciplinary study of service that  combines  perspectives  from  fields  of  science,  management,  engineering,  and  design  to  innovate service systems. With strong support by leading IT companies, such as IBM, service  science has already had a global impact, with hundreds of universities worldwide already  offering courses, programs, or degrees related to service science, and with dozens of academic  research institutes and groups appearing. Since HICSS-41, the minitrack has accepted 115  papers (acceptance rate under 50% overall, and about 40% over the last five years), and  published some of the best in the journals, Information Systems and e-Business Management  and INFORMS Service Science. This minitrack has been a platform for researchers and  practitioners from around the world to share work and exchange ideas. If approved for 2023,  this minitrack will continue to be a major forum for sharing state-of-the-art research results and  further development of this emerging discipline, and HICSS will remain a leading venue for  service science.   Service science deals with the design, development, and managerial issues concerning  “service systems,” integrated, value-creating configurations of service providers, their clients,  their partners, and others. The best-performing service systems are IT-enabled, customer- centered,  relationship-focused,  and  knowledge-intensive  –  yet  span  multiple  formal  and  informal organizations. Because of this multidisciplinary context, researchers and practitioners  in management, social sciences, and computer sciences are all working to increase service  innovation. These multiple perspectives can be unified using the theoretical construct of the  service system, in which entities (people, businesses, government agencies, etc.) interact to co- create value via value propositions that describe dynamic re-configurations of resources. In  fact, over the last few years of this minitrack, this framework of value creation in complex  service  systems,  which  requires  elaborating  various  stakeholder  perspectives  and  understanding the broad context of use for specific cases to enable effective value creation  especially given advanced and autonomous technology, has emerged as the central unifying  framework across many papers and presentations. If approved for 2023, the minitrack will  focus on papers that connect rigorous disciplinary research with the emerging interdisciplinary  framework  of  value  creation  in  service  systems,  focusing  particularly  on  innovation,  technology, and the digital economy.  As ever more people in academia and industry recognize the need for service innovation,    1  HICSS remains an excellent venue for this emerging discipline. The HICSS community can  continue to play a leadership role. To that end, this minitrack will encourage submission of  research papers from a variety of disciplines and a variety of participating communities to  address issues in service policies, service process modeling, service delivery management,  innovative  service  technologies,  and  the  role  of  the  Internet,  the  digital  economy,  and  information  technology.  We  will  encourage  submissions  related  to  autonomous  service  systems, the use data and information for value creation, and computational modeling of  complex,  human-centered  service  systems,  particularly  with  applications  for  the  digital  economy.     1b.

Dr. Paul P. Maglio is a professor of management, Chair of the Department of Management of  Complex Systems, and Director of the Division of Management and Information at the  University of California, Merced. He holds a bachelor's degree in computer science and  engineering from MIT and an M.S. and a Ph.D. in cognitive science from the University of  California at San Diego. One of the founders of the field of service science, Dr Maglio served  as Editor-in-Chief of the INFORMS journal Service Science (2013-2018), serves as an editorial  board member of the Journal of Service Research, and serves as lead editor of the Handbook  of Service Science (with Volume II published in 2018). Dr. Maglio founded the California  Center for Service Science at the University of California. He is an ACM Distinguished  Scientist, and has published many scientific papers in various areas of computer science,  cognitive science, and service science.     2. Technical area  The trend of increasing contributions to economic outputs from services-related activities  in major countries pushes the focus on service innovation to be a major part of most business  models. Even in traditionally manufacturing-driven industries, such as IT and related industries,  the importance of service has surpassed most other corporate competencies. From the outset,  efforts in creating, composing, and delivering services call for systematic studies of managerial,  technical, and social issues. Pioneers in service research have moved service research up to the  inflection point, and now there is a great need of a wider range of service research. Combining  managerial, organizational, and technical perspectives, service science research and education  aims to create service professionals with technological, business, and social-organizational  abilities.  This minitrack will continue to serve as a primary forum for researchers and practitioners  to share progress in the pursuit of answering these and related questions. In HICSS-41, we  received 25 submissions and accepted 15 papers; in HICSS-42, we received 14 and accepted  9; in HICSS-43, we received 18 and accepted 9; in HICSS-44, we received 21 and accepted 10;  in HICSS-45, we received 12 and accepted 8; in HICSS-46, we received 17 and accepted 9; in  HICSS-47, we received 17 and accepted 9; in HICSS-48, we received 19 and accepted 9; in  HICSS-49, we received 15 and accepted 7, in HICSS-50, we received 16 and accepted 6; in    3  HICSS-51, we received 10 and accepted 3; in HICSS-52, we received 13 and accepted 6; in  HICSS-53, we received 13 and accepted 6; in HICSS-54, we received 11 and accepted 4; and  in HICSS-55, we received 10 and accepted 5. We expect to receive enough papers to organize  one or two presentation sessions.   Though in prior years, this minitrack had fairly general calls-for-papers, encouraging  submissions from a range of areas, in the last five years, it had a more narrow focus on service  theory, service design, service innovation, service engineering, and service technology. In 2023,  we will continue our narrow focus. Specifically, the Service Science minitrack will focus on  the use of information technology and the effects of the digital economy on services, including  but not limited to: (1) the increasing capabilities of technologies in service, such as autonomous  technologies, and the roles of people and technologies in creating autonomous service systems;  (2) the increasingly large role played by data and information in complex service systems,  including the ways sensing and analytics influence value creation in the digital economy and  potential ethical challenges created by the sorts of data collection and analyses that can now be  conducted in real-time; and (3) the potential for computational modeling techniques, such as  agent-based simulation, to inform the theory and design of complex, human-centered service  systems, especially in the digital context, such as blockchain technologies, internet of things,  etc.     3. Community Development for Service Science    The emergence of service science as a research discipline has made a global impact.  A  number of conferences, symposia, and workshops related to service science have appeared over  the last few years, but none of these are dedicated to development of research and theory for  service systems and service science in an informal and edgy setting. HICSS, since its launch  56 years ago, has been exploring new ideas and frontiers within the realm of system sciences,  and therefore makes the perfect venue for this multidisciplinary study of services from a system  standpoint. The HICSS community in particular, with its unique multidisciplinary focus, can  and should lead service science development. Our minitrack will continue to facilitate the  shaping of the service science research agenda and the development of the service science  research community at HICSS.     4. Statements  Institutes of two co-chairs endorse our involvement in the HICSS minitrack and that the  travel and registration cost to attend HICSS will be covered. At least one minitrack chair will  attend the conference.  The collaboration of three co-chairs for this minitrack is necessary.   We commit our best efforts to promoting this minitrack to connect with the global knowledge  networks on service science.  Professor Lin’s university is the frontier university to promote  service science education and research, and through the international networks of the Service    4  Science Society of Taiwan, Professor Lin could strengthen the link with other institutes world- wide to make this minitrack as a major outlet of their research results.   Professor Maglio was  the global leader of service science at IBM, and given his roles as a professor in the School of  Engineering at the University of California, Merced, and director of the California Center for  Service Science, his being a minitrack co-chair will help the HICSS community reach out to  practitioners and engineers, as well as the core service science community around the world  through his leadership of the INFORMS journal Service Science (as immediate past Editor-in- Chief). The partnership between the two co-chairs will help bring together Information Systems  academic research, industrial practices, and the global service science academic network. We  plan to explore interesting synergy in this minitrack by reaching out to the related yet distinct  communities that the co-chairs represent.    5 "

Box 21220   FI-00076 AALTO, Finland  email: virpi.tuunainen@aalto.fi  Mobile: +358-50-5897541            In this minitrack, we seek new research describing smart mobility ecosystems and novel  digital services for mobility. The submissions can be research papers, case studies, or  practitioner reports related to service development and their implications.     After hosting minitracks on Open Data and “Openness” in service research agenda at  HICSS-48 and HICSS-49, as well as HICSS-50 and HICSS-51 minitracks on open services  and service platforms, a HICSS-52 minitrack on new blockchain uses, and a HICSS-54 and  HICSS-55 minitrack on Smart Mobility Services, we now propose continuing the HICSS- 55 minitrack on Smart Mobility Ecosystems and Services.  Proposed Topic:  Transportation  is  changing  and  this  change  is  driven  by  technology-driven  trends:  autonomy, connectivity, electrification and diverse mobility business models of shared  vehicles. At the same time, there is a drive towards more sustainable transportation. Digital  platforms  and  services  are  essential  for  orchestrating  sustainable  smart  mobility  ecosystems and related services: data that represents accurately, for instance, location of  passengers and service providers, weather, usage and maintenance is a cornerstone for  service design. Identification and communication systems that link specific physical things  to specific digital addresses offer possibilities to communicate, transact, pay, build trust,  sense and activate “things” from the internet – and design novel services based on this  generated data. Autonomous vehicles, electric cars and mobility related sharing economy  services all build on platform thinking, as do many services reducing the need for travel to  begin with. Furthermore, for these services to work, there is a need to analyze the  ecosystems emerging around these services, as the services and platforms form complex  webs.     Autonomous vehicles have been hailed as harbingers of new kinds of mobility and travel  services. Autonomous cars seem still to be further away from wider prevalence than  expected a couple of years ago, but the data gathered for them and made available from  e.g. smart city initiatives and mobile devices provides great opportunities for different  kinds of smart mobility services, related to both private and public transportation. Also  shipping industry, especially in cargo shipping, has already many ongoing advanced  projects and pilots, and in aviation, autonomous aircrafts are being developed by several  companies. In closed and/or hazardous environments, such as mines, autonomous vehicles  are already working. Autonomous vehicles on land, in see and air (including drones) are  expected to decrease costs and increase efficiency and safety, but a host of regulatory,  safety, legal and security challenges are yet to be resolved.    More acutely, electric cars are increasingly embraced by car owners and they require their  own set of infrastructure and services. Full scale charging infrastructure needs building,  and it requires a lot of mobile services to support it. Some are simple, like applications that  show location and availability of charging station, and some more complex, like payment  systems for charging and - in the near future - for trading electricity stored in car batteries,  which can be used in smart grids to balance peaks of consumption. Societal benefits of  moving from fossil fuels to electricity in terms of reduction of pollution are quite evident,  but in addition to insufficient charging infrastructure, limited driving range, high costs and  battery issues still act as barriers to wider acceptance.    At the same time there is growing concerns about sustainability of current practices of  mobility and travel. Mobility related sharing economy services as well as different types  of fleet services are seen as viable options to privately owned cars, but they have their own  challenges, such as added congestion in cities, reconfiguring existing modes of (especially  public) transportation, disrupting incumbent industries and widening the power imbalance  between the platform owners and “independent contractors”. These services require the  ability to connect to these specific platforms and seem to be prone to strong location and  availability-based network effects. Examples of these services are on one hand Uber and  Lyft type of services and on the other hand, in the near future, autonomous transportation  of people as well as cargo through fleets of autonomous vehicles on land, water and air.    At the same time concerns about business traveling has become acute in many countries  and there are movements to limit both work and leisure travel when possible. Could smart  digital services and apps offer alternatives for travel, or could there be services that  propose the best ways to limit the carbon footprint of travel?    In addition to usage of mobility value services, we are also interested in their development,  design  and  service  innovation.  Furthermore,  social,  societal  and  potential  customer  segmentation issues are of great interest. In this proposed minitrack we take stock of what  is the state of the art in current mobility services and service ecosystems and what is coming  in the near future.    As HICSS is addressing leading edge developments, we especially encourage submissions  on new subareas, such as, sustainable travel services, autonomous transportation services,  and privacy and security concepts.     Relevant topics for this minitrack include (but are not limited to):     •  Transportation ecosystems and services  •  Smart traffic services  •  Autonomous and connected vehicle development  •  Autonomous vehicle (land, see, air) business models  •  User issues in different smart traffic services  •  Location-based services and business models related to mobility   •  Business value of transportation and mobility services   •  Data privacy and quality in mobility services  •  Data sharing and ownership issues hampering data utilization in mobility services  •  Sustainable travel services  •  Value added services for travelers (usage, location, maintenance data)  •  Business and societal issues related to autonomous vehicles (land, see, air)  •  Technological challenges of adaptivity of services        Topics Covered in earlier HICSS and Other Conferences and Publications      In the HICSS-54 and HICSS-55 minitrack on Smart Mobility Services (both with the same  organization) attracted quantitatively a modest amount, but high-quality submissions and  resulted in interesting and continued discussion at the virtual conference sessions. In  HICSS-44 related topics of smart cities and smart services were discussed in a few other  minitracks.

Taking profit from the main advantages of each individual technique, they can work  in a cooperative way to solve lots of complex real-world problems: those for which more  conventional methods have not yielded low cost, analytic, and complete solutions. Earlier  computational approaches could model and precisely analyze only relatively simple  systems. However, more complex systems arising in biology, health, economy, digital  world, and similar fields, often remained intractable to conventional mathematical and  analytical  methods.  Therefore,  the  advances  in  soft  computing  techniques  play  an  important role in analyzing and modeling more complex systems. Soft computing deals  with imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and approximation to achieve computability,  robustness  and  low  solution  cost,  which  can  better  deal  with  large-scale,  fast  and  unstructured changes that occur as part of the digital world.  This minitrack aims to attract researchers with an interest in the research area described  above. Specifically, not only contributions on theoretical innovations are welcome, but  also those describing different problem-solving benefits by using soft computing-based  methodologies, in particular, in the fields of digital world, digital coaching, digital health,  digital economy, and cognitive computing. We are interested in the contributions where  the applied/defined methodologies used are either analysis- or systems-oriented. They  may have an experimental or empirical focus. Innovative studies are favored, which  combine innovative theoretical results with a careful empirical verification, or good  empirical problem solving, planning or decision making with innovative theory building.  A common denominator for all studies is the building and use of soft computing-based  models.   Topics appropriate for this minitrack include, but are not limited, to:  •  Machine learning.  •  Neural networks.  •  Support vector machines.  •  Fuzzy reasoning.  •  Fuzzy logic.  •  Fuzzy decision making.  •  Neuro fuzzy.  •  Evolutionary computation.  •  Evolutionary algorithms.  •  Genetic algorithms.  •  Differential evolution.  •  Swarm intelligence.  1    •  Bio-inspired systems.  •  Ant colony optimization.  •  Particle swarm optimization.  •  Bayesian networks.  •  Software for soft computing.  •  Natural language processing based on soft computing techniques.  Marketing plan, i.e, how do you plan to solicit papers  We will send emails with the information of this minitrack to the authors working in the  above topics. In addition, we will promote this minitrack in all the conferences related to  soft computing in which we will assist.  Journals for fast-track opportunities  Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence.

This also incorporates issues related to digital transformation in this area. Methods include optimization, heuristics, metaheuristics and matheuristics, simulation, agent technologies, and descriptive as well as predictive methods. Recent advances incorporating Internet of Things, big data, cloud computing, and machine learning are especially welcome.   Minitrack description:  General prelude: This minitrack is a continuation of the successful minitrack “Intelligent Decision Support for Logistics and Supply Chain Management” (or under a slightly different title) of HICSS-36 through HICSS-55. In each case, accepted papers were usually presented in one to three sessions. Often an open forum on future issues of e-logistics and the minitrack took place. According to the trends in decision science, the session in HICSS-53 was leaned towards the application of data science, specifically machine learning. The sessions were usually attended by 15 to 20 people with exceptions in 2005 and 2017 where attendance was somewhat higher at about 20-25 and 2018 and 2019 when it was slightly lower. Acceptance rate was usually around 50%. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-22, minitrack sessions took place online with an pleasing number of authors and attendees around 10-15 people.  In recent years there were some interesting activities arising out of the minitrack, including a well-recognized interview on Decision Analytics which had appeared in the journal Business & Information Systems Engineering in 2014 [DOI 10.1007/s12599-014-0328-2]. Advertising the minitrack will be done by using established conferences (like the International Conference on Computational Logistics website and address lists), LinkedIn groups (e.g., the Verolog list which is affiliated with a European Working Group on vehicle routing and logistics) and collaboration networks, e.g., the IFIP working group, as well as in academic mailing lists, e.g., demanet.   Content: Information technology (IT) and information systems (IS) are prerequisites and enablers for successful supply chain management (SCM). With related advances, the logistics and SCM field is developing very dynamically. Business-to-business transactions are made via the Internet and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems support managing the transactional information within the enterprise. Cooperation and coordination are only possible based on IT and IS. While the latter are vital components in supply chains, their successful management rests on intelligent and coordinated decision making throughout the logistics network. Intelligent decision support and decision analytics using advanced decision technologies and analytics methodology are of utmost importance in logistics and SCM. Sensor networks, RFID deployment, social network activities, internet search histories and retail transactions are just a few examples of sources to provide data to support efficient decision analytics. Big data issues are well recognized and offer opportunities long waited for but also provide challenges in handling and decision analytics. Cloud computing allows also small and medium sized enterprises to access resources to support analytics functions. Business intelligence and data mining can be used to store and analyze logistics, product, inventory, and sales information. Simulation and optimization, which can be found in advanced planning and scheduling systems, can be employed for, e.g., logistics as well as inventory, production, procurement, and distribution planning. Intelligent agents can, e.g., communicate with different partners in the supply chain, assist in collecting information, share product information, negotiate prices, and distribute alerts throughout the logistics networks. The design and implementation of intelligent decision analytics tools to support human agents in computational logistics and SCM is a very active field in research, consulting, and software development. The same is valid for systems as the Internet of Things that combine engineering topics of sensor systems, software engineering, and decision analytics in such a fashion that decisions are automized. Many such technologies or systems are continuously being developed, implemented, and used in real-world scenarios. We do, therefore, believe that this minitrack will be recognized by both the scientific community and practitioners developing or using logistics and SCM solutions.  We aim at organizing a minitrack consisting of one to two sessions depending on the number of high-quality submissions. We seek papers dealing with decision analytics, business intelligence, big data, cloud computing, industrial engineering, and decision technologies which contribute to intelligent decision support in the whole field of logistics and in all categories of SCM. This includes but is not restricted to simulation, optimization, heuristics, metaheuristics, agent technologies, decision analytics, descriptive models, and data mining. Recent advances in data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence successfully complement these methods. We are especially interested in real-world applications and in information systems and software solutions which assist in solving decision problems. This is extended towards, e.g., computational logistics, advanced planning systems, and the intelligent use of ERP systems. Also, conceptual ideas, reports on projects in progress, and case studies are welcome. Moreover, teaching cases both at the university as well as the executive level may be of interest.

Title of a mini-track    Social Robots - Robotics and Toy Computing      2. The track that this mini-track belongs    Decision Analytics, Mobile Services & Service Science      3. Description of a mini-track  The pervasive nature of digital technologies as witnessed in the industry, services, and everyday life has  given rise to an emergent, data-focused economy stemming from many aspects of human individuals and the  Internet of Things (IoT). The richness and vastness of these data are creating unprecedented research  opportunities in many fields, including urban studies, geography, economics, finance, entertainment, social  science, physics, biology and genetics, public health, and many other smart devices. As businesses build out  emerging hardware and software infrastructure, it becomes increasingly important to anticipate technical and  practical challenges and to identify best practices learned through experience in this research area. A social  (companion) robot, such as SoftBank Robotics’ Pepper and ASUS’ Zenbo, consists of a physical humanoid  robot component that connects through a network infrastructure to online services that enhance traditional  robot functionality. Humanoid robots usually behave like natural social interaction partners for human users,  with features such as speech, gestures, and eye-gaze, referring to the users’ data and social background. The  usage behavior of anthropomorphic robots indicates that users are more open to robots. For example, some  prior research shows that it is much easier for an embodied humanoid robot to trust users to release their  personal information than a disembodied interactive kiosk. Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is a research area  of understanding, designing, and evaluating robots for use by or with humans from the social-technical  perspectives.  Recently AI technologies have been applied to robotic and toy computing. Robotic computing is one branch  of AI technologies, and their synergistic interactions enable by robots. Social robots can now easily capture  a user’s physical activity state (e.g., walking, standing, running, etc.) and store personalized information (e.g.,  face, voice, location, activity pattern, etc.) through the camera, microphone, and sensors AI technologies.  Toy computing is a recently developing concept that transcends the traditional toy into a new computer  research area using AI technologies. A toy in this context can be effectively considered a computing device  or peripheral called Smart Toys. We invite research and industry papers related to these specific challenges  and others driving innovation in robotics and toy computing for social robots.  Based on the past six years of this mini-track in HICSS-50, HICSS-51, HICSS-52, HICSS-53, HICSS-54  and HICSS-55, the seventh year’s goal is to continue presenting both novel and industrial solutions to  challenging technical issues as well as compelling use cases. In addition, this mini-track will share related  practical  experiences  to benefit  the  reader  and provide  clear  proof  that  robotic  and  toy  computing  technologies play an ever-increasing essential and critical role in supporting social robots - a new cross- discipline research topic in social science, computer science, decision science, and information systems. With  a general focus on social robots and their related robotics and toy computing, this mini-track covers related  topics such as:    •  Social Technical Issues  •  Human Behavior Study  •  Human-Robot Interaction  •  Business Models  •  Conceptual and Technical Architecture  •  Visualization Technologies  •  Modeling and Implementation  •  Security, Privacy, and Trust    1 •  Industry Standards and Solution Stacks  •  Provenance Tracking Frameworks and Tools  •  Case Studies (e.g., smart toys, healthcare, financial, aviation, etc.)    This proposed mini-track aims to crystallize this emerging research domain and trends into positive efforts  to focus on the most promising research and industrial solutions. The papers will provide clear proof that  social robots and AI technologies play a more important and critical role in supporting robotic and toy  computing applications. It is expected that the papers will further research on new best practices and  directions in this research domain.       4. Marketing plan    To guarantee maximum quality, in addition to inviting the authors in HICSS-50, HICSS-51, HICSS-52,  HICSS-53, HICSS-54 and HICSS-55 to submit high-quality papers for HICSS-56, we will circulate the CFP  to leading academic mailing lists (e.g., ISWorld, DBWorld, SEWORLD, etc.) as well as the mailing lists of  the affiliated universities in our collaboration network. We are currently securing a journal special issue for  the accepted papers in HICSS-56. We will solicit reviewers from our colleagues and key researchers in the  related research area. We will also form a group of students to assist in inviting high-quality papers from  various related research communities such as a database, services computing, and computer in entertainment.      5.

However, most of these services and applications lack generalizable models and strategies on how they are used in the interactions of firms, their customers and service beneficiaries. The existing literature introduces various affordances these technologies offer but the research lacks assessments of meaningful business outcomes such as service scalability and sales, and behavioral outcomes like user satisfaction, loyalty, and purchase behavior. Integrating research on technology affordances with meaningful business and behavioral outcomes is necessary to build both theoretical understanding and practical implications. In order to do so, more literature reviews, conceptual papers, field and user studies as well as laboratory experiments are needed. The objective of these studies should be to introduce propositions for both businesses, service personnel, users and customers as well as show the improvements (or the lack of them) compared to existing and conventional systems. These studies should also aim at scrutinizing technology features and system designs as well as psychological and behavioral patterns behind the meaningful business outcomes in order to build valid research models and related strategy implications. Mixed reality technologies and systems have increasingly merged with other contemporary media technologies (e.g., video content, second screens, visualization technologies, companion apps, motion tracking, avatars, digital twins, 360-environments, virtual worlds, metaverse systems). Research regarding these new systems calls for generalizability due to the constantly changing environment. But as the saying goes “exception proves the rule” — it is also important to showcase notable exceptions and outliers and create new research avenues.

The technological revolution or the  second industrial revolution used electric power to create mass production. Both of these transformed the way people  worked and lived and made people wealthier and more urban. A third industrial revolution, marked by digital technologies,  access and manufacturing, used electronics and information technology to automate production. The fourth industrial  revolution is on the immediate horizon characterized by a fusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between the  physical, digital and biological spheres. Unlike those that preceded, the fourth industrial revolution is evolving at an  exponential pace, disrupting almost every industry on a global landscape, inevitably leading to profound impact on  business, government, health, and people. The rapid pace and demand of an increasingly more digital world necessarily  mandates that analytics will play a key role as we need to make rapid sense of complex and fast changes driven by big,  real-time data. We are moving into an era in which being able to “see” the information in the data will no longer be  optional and sophisticated visualization methods facilitating rapid understanding will be a critical piece of the “competitive  edge”.    Interactive Visual Analytics and Visualization for Decision Making supports human decision making through interaction  with data and statistical and machine learning processes, with applications in a broad range of situations where human  expertise must be brought to bear on problems characterized by massive datasets and data that are uncertain in fact,  relevance, location in space and position in time. Current applications include environmental science and technologies,  natural resources and energy, health and related life sciences, precision medicine, safety and security and business  processes. Submissions are encouraged that extend the areas of use to new analytic tasks in science and technology,  public health, business intelligence, financial analysis, social sciences, and other domains. Particular emphasis will be given  to submissions that use visual analytics for social change discovery, analysis, communication, and focus on mixed initiative  analysis recognizing that human and machine have a distinct division of labor in the problem-solving process. Submissions  may include studies of visual analytics and decision support in the context of an organization (e.g., communication  between analysts and policy-makers), perceptual and cognitive aspects of the analytic task, Interactive Machine Learning,  and collaborative analysis using visual information systems. Additionally, submissions may include understandable,  trustable AI as well as human-guided AI to round out the problem-solving process.   This proposal builds upon our successful HICSS-47, HICSS-48, HICSS-49, HICSS-50, HICSS-51, HICSS-52, HICSS-53 and HICSS- 54 minitracks on visual analytics for decision support and our earlier minitracks on visual analytics, mobile computing, and  digital media at scale. It seeks to define analytical methods and technologies that use interactive visualization to meet  challenges posed by data, platforms, and applications for decision making and risk-based decision making:   •  Visual analytics and visualization in digital economies  •  Visual analytics and visualization in “wicked” problems  •  Visualization in organizational analytics  •  Visualization and analysis of datasets of varying size and complexity from archives and real-time streams  •  Collaborative visual analysis and operational coordination within and across organizations.  •  Interactive and visual risk-based decision making  •  Interactive machine learning methods  •  Managing response time of complex analytical tasks  •  Effective deployment and case studies of success from deployed visualization and analytics experiences  •  Visualization and analytics for data-driven policy making and decision support  •  Issues and challenges in evaluation of visual decision making   •  Mixed-initiative analysis methods for decision making  •  Cognitive and social science aspects of visual decision-making environments  For HICSS 2022, we encourage authors to address these themes from their own research perspectives. Authors are  encouraged to bring the lens of their own background and expertise to focus on the analytics of the data itself and  coordination of multiple levels of analysis, decision-making and operations to the design and evaluation of effective  presentations for stakeholders.    Both algorithmic “data sciences” approaches and human-centered ""visualization"" and “visual analytics” human-computer  interface methods hold great promise for operationalizing massive datasets and streaming data in support of a broad  range of human activities. Applications in basic scientific research, business analytics, digital economies, health sciences,  environmental science and engineering R&D explore the implications of these methods for advancement of knowledge  and strategic planning. Applications in coordination, command and control of complex human activities such as crowd and  traffic management, disaster relief, law enforcement, and national and cyber security add the constraints of real-time  performance and distribution of planning to the challenges faced.   For this minitrack, we invite computational, cognitive, and organizational perspectives on advanced data processing and  interactive visualization across a range of human endeavors. We also invite participation from researchers who are looking  at scaling issues and multiscale issues, whether these scales refer to the time of decision making, the form-factor and  operational constraints of mobile devices, the number of decision makers or the more traditional notion of multiscale  simulation and real-world scales of data. We are particularly interested in approaches that combine computational and  interactive analytics in “mixed initiative” or Interactive Machine Learning systems, decision support in the context of an  organization (e.g. communication between analysts and policy-makers), perceptual and cognitive aspects of the analytic  task, and collaborative analysis using visual information systems.   Technical	Description	 There is a substantial need for advances in the ability to address large volumes of disparate data, streams from distributed  locations, rapid (often real-time) response, and visual representations on platforms ranging from mobile to large-scale  displays. Gaining maximum benefit from these datasets also demands novel ways of supporting the judgment of skilled  human decision-makers, such as information visualization, human-information interaction, and studies of individual and  collaborative decision-making and coordination of action. Bridging human understanding and computational analysis is  necessary not only for analysts but for policy-makers and operational personnel, making this a broadly interdisciplinary  effort. Bridging these areas of investigation is key to the success of this minitrack. We believe communication, in the HICSS  setting, will cross-pollinate ideas that will advance the state-of-the-art for this class of problems.   From a computational perspective, the challenges of large-volume data, streaming data, and reduced response time  initially appear to be quite distinct. Upon closer inspection, they are often found to be encountering very similar constraint  issues from different perspectives. Fundamentally all algorithms trade off space, time, data volume, and accuracy. If we  can solve a problem on a desktop today, we will expect to be able to solve it on an iPhone or hand-held device tomorrow.  If we solve it with cluster, cloud, or supercomputing today, we expect to solve it locally, tomorrow. Thus, this minitrack  seeks to bring together those working in areas of massive datasets, streaming data, rapid model construction, across a  range of computational footprints and time constraints.   Marketing	plan	 The minitrack was offered successfully in the Decision Analytics and Service Sciences Track at HICSS-47 through HICSS-54  in 2020, and at HICSS 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 under the Digital Media: Content and Communication Track. In 2016,  2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, we had a very successful tutorial on Visual Analytics that attracted around 60 people as well  as  the  minitrack  having  great  submissions,  attendance  and  interest.  We  conducted  the  minitrack  as  a  series  of  presentations with ample time for discussion on each of the topics. That format allowed for significantly more organic  discussion than a strict presentation format with limited time for questions. We plan to repeat this format again. The  organizers for this minitrack include the director of a US Department of Homeland Security Center of Excellence in Visual  Analytics and a theme leader in the companion Center in Data Sciences. These centers together have over 100 active  researchers in the area covered by this proposed minitrack. We will continue our focus on the cognitive sciences  perspective in interactive visual analytics with Brian Fisher as a co-organizer. The third co-organizer is the Director of  Health Analytics (previously the Director of Visualization) at the largest US open science supercomputing center and an  Associate Professor in Women’s Health at the university medical school and brings a perspective on interactively  visualizing data at scale. Additionally, she has initiated activities at her home institution that research visual analytics  methods for informing social action and change. We will bring this success to HICSS-55 by reaching out to those that have  participated in social action/change at those events. We feel this topic is particularly timely and we will reach out  immediately upon acceptance to allow researchers ample time to submit their work. All organizers are committed to  recruiting participants from their respective organizations and from the larger research community. We will also reach out  to the Interactive machine learning/deep learning community and to the perceptual and cognitive science (e.g. decision  science) communities. We will also work to liaise with our collaborators on European visual analytics and data sciences  initiatives, such as the German-American project on Visual Analytics for Security Applications and the German DFG Priority  Program  “Scalable  Visual  Analytics”.  Together  these  provide  ample  opportunities  to  recruit  reviewers  as  well  as  submissions. We plan to again submit a companion tutorial to provide a hands-on focus. Moreover, we plan to advertise  in the INFORMS list, several EU-based lists, as well as target business and finance research listservs. The organizers have  also marketed a corresponding tutorial that provides more detail on sub-topics of relevance to this minitrack. We will put  in another tutorial proposal for HICSS-55 with particular emphasis on visual analytics informing advancement for society  and positive social change.   Previous	Events	 The minitrack was offered successfully at HICSS-54, HICSS-53 (two sessions), HICSS-52 (two sessions), HICSS-51, HICSS-50,  HICSS-49, and HICSS-48 with over 38 attendees and HICSS-47 with over 25 attendees during the last sessions of the  conference, as well as HICSS 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 under the Digital Media: Content and Communication Track. The  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers has offered a Symposium and later a Conference on Visual Analytics Science  and Technology for six years. The organizers put on a 2014 symposium at the Association for Psychological Science annual  meeting and participated in the 2015 symposia at SPIE Visual Data Analysis and the 2015 iConference. The minitrack chairs  have organized symposia on this topic at the Cognitive Science Society in 2007 and 2010. Individual workshops on the  cognitive science and mathematics of visual analytics were hosted in 2008 by Simon Fraser University and the University  of British Columbia in Vancouver Canada and in 2006 by the University of California at Berkeley in California.  Additionally,  a workshop on visualization and analytics for public policy and decision making was held in 2012. Two successful  workshops on interaction for visual analytics and decision making were held in 2013 in Banff and Dagstuhl, Germany.  Finally, this growth in workshops shows strong evidence for growing interest in this topic in what appears to be a  broadening audience with attendees’ backgrounds ranging from cognitive science, to computer science to those in some  form of decision support systems.

Yet, much of the current efforts have focused on advancing underlying algorithms and not on decreasing the complexity of AI systems. AI systems are still “black boxes” that are difficult to comprehend—not only for developers, but particularly for users and decision-makers (Meske et al. 2022). In addition, the development and use of AI is associated with many risks and pitfalls like biases in data or predictions based on spurious correlations (“Clever Hans” phenomena) (Lapuschkin et al. 2019), which eventually may lead to malfunctioning or biased AI and hence technologically driven discrimination.  This is where research on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) comes in. Also referred to as “transparent,” “interpretable,” or “understandable AI”, XAI aims to “produce explainable models, while maintaining a high level of learning performance (prediction accuracy); and enable human users to understand, appropriately, trust, and effectively manage the emerging generation of artificially intelligent partners” (DARPA 2017). XAI hence refers to “the movement, initiatives, and efforts made in response to AI transparency and trust concerns, more than to a formal technical concept” (Adadi and Berrada 2018, p. 52140). XAI is designed user-centric in that users are empowered to scrutinize and appropriately trust AI (Förster, Klier, Kluge and Sigler 2020), eventually impacting task performance of users (Kühl, Lobana and Meske 2019). With a focus on decision support, this minitrack aims to explore and extend research on how to establish explainability of intelligent black box systems—machine learning-based or not. We especially look for contributions that investigate XAI from either a developer’s or user’s perspective. We invite submissions from all application domains, such as healthcare, finance, e-commerce, retail, public administration or others. Technically and method-oriented studies, case studies as well as design science or behavioral science approaches are welcome.  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: The users’ perspective on XAI Theorizing XAI-human interactions Presentation and personalization of AI explanations for different target groups XAI to increase situational awareness, compliance behavior and task performance XAI for transparency and unbiased decision making Impact of explainability on AI-based decision support systems use and adoption Explainability of AI in crisis situations Potential harm of explainability in AI Identifying user-centric requirements for XAI systems  The developers’ perspective on XAI XAI to open, control and evaluate black box algorithms Using XAI to identify bias in data Explainability and Human-in-the-Loop development of AI XAI to support interactive machine learning Prevention and detection of deceptive AI explanations XAI to discover deep knowledge and learn from AI Designing and deploying XAI systems Addressing user-centric requirements for XAI systems  The governments’ perspective on XAI XAI and compliance Explainability and transparency policy guidelines  Evidence base benefits and challenges of XAI expectations and implementations  References: Adadi A., Berrada M.

The minitrack seeks both conceptual and empirical approaches to these two themes. Conceptual papers should address foundational scholarship and theories —e.g., important interventions for thinking about information exchange in communities and societies, key ideas, paradigms, and methods. Empirical papers should draw on original studies of digital and social media that illustrate the critical or ethical dimensions of digital infrastructures, social media platforms, or data use.  Potential paper topics could explore the following topics and themes: studies of the perpetuation of gender, race, ethno-nationalist, and faith-based hostility and bullying found in a range of online environments;  studies of the values and worldviews embedded within specific hardware and software technologies;  studies that look at the political economies and labor conditions of digital content creation, digital work, and the consequences of sharing economy platforms;  studies that look at mediated representations and practices of political community;  studies that examine digital power relations between individuals, collectives, and societal institutions.  case studies that grapple with the challenges and opportunities of unequal data access among digital and social media researchers (e.g., APIs, open vs. proprietary data);  studies that explore the situated ethics of social media research in different digital contexts studies of the environmental impact that digital and social media researchers have on the planet by using and reusing data and metadata stored in resource-intensive ways;  studies of academic collaborations with controversial actors (e.g., military units, immigration enforcement officials, lobbying groups);  studies that mobilize non-traditional or experimental research methods developed for the specificities of digital and social media.

It is also changing the way we access and consume media, stay in touch with family and friends, as well as how we communicate in our online communities. We also recognize that far-reaching conversations can be manipulated through social media. For example, political and social polarization are being exacerbated by online, and at times, algorithmically enhanced, echo chambers. These phenomena commonly generate a tremendous volume of data that can be analyzed and mined for both research and commercial purposes.

This minitrack addresses the gap between data and methods in social science research by providing a venue to discuss methodological issues and approaches to conducting research with digital and social media data. We welcome papers related to methodological challenges for researchers including, but not limited to: (1) the need for new methods for data collection and analysis, (2) adaptations of existing methods (3) issues of representation and sampling, (4) ephemerality of social media and digital trace data, (5) holistic collection of digital social media data and associated content such as images/URLs/video, (6) preservation, archiving, and data sharing, and (7) impact of changing platform affordances, interfaces, designs, and APIs. Indeed, there has been an explosion of research using social media data to study human behavior and social interaction in almost every domain of social science. The body of literature using digital and social media data is growing at a staggering rate, but accompanying methodological contributions about the process of conducting research with digital and social media data remains thin. The existing methodological literature is typically tool or technology driven, and not a result of empirical examination of the data collection process.This leaves researchers without an understanding of how to approach or evaluate the social media data collection process, and in turn, how to appropriately interpret findings from this type of research. As a result, researchers, practitioners, and students are left to continually reinvent the wheel by learning through a process of trial and error. Journals for fast track opportunities, if any We are re-exploring opportunities for fast track opportunities. Marketing plan We will market the track to researchers via mailing lists and social media sites for the Association of Internet Researchers, SOCNET, EASA Media Anthropology Network, CHI, CWCW, ASA, HASTAC, and the International Communication Association (Communication and Technology Division and Computational Methods Interest Group). In addition, we will leverage our personal networks.

Digital and social media (DSM) have transformed the workplace in organizations. During the  past two decades, electronic communication has changed organizational forms, enabled  electronic document management, and preserved organizational storage.  Combined with the  growth of digital and social media technologies, organizations have been impacted in new  ways. Social media includes blogs, wikis, social networking sites, and microblogging that provide  new affordances to its users.  While some prior studies have provided evidence to show the  positive impacts of enterprise social media on employees, work processes and performance,  other studies have uncovered negative effects of DSM use on employee productivity and  behaviors. For an organization to amplify the returns or benefits and to mitigate the drawbacks  of their DSM use, it is imperative for both researchers and practitioners to deepen their  understanding of the implications of DSM use for organizational purposes.     Since spring 2020, the global outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has increased  enterprise social media (ESM) use at home offices when companies sent employees to work  from home. The increasing use of ESM in home office environments has called for further  research on the effects of ESM use on employee well-being, work-life balance, social media  fatigue, and work performance during and post the COVID-19 pandemic.    This mini-track focuses on organizations’ internal and external use of digital and social media to  facilitate work processes (e.g., communication, collaboration and socialization) inclusive of both  business (for-profit) and non-profit organizations and to engage various organizational  stakeholders. Hence, research of this mini-track lies at the intersection of multiple disciplines,  namely Science & Technology, Organization Science, Marketing, and Behavioral Science.     The Call for Papers welcomes theoretical and empirical studies addressing organizational,  managerial, technical, and behavioral perspectives on digital and social media by enterprises  and their employees.  Potential issues and topics include, but are not limited to:  •  Digital and social media affordances  •  Dark side of enterprise social media  •  Digital and social media marketing  •  Diversity, equity, and inclusion on enterprise social media platforms  •  Digital and social media use & employee work-life balance   1    •  Digital and social media use & Information privacy and security  •  Digital and social media use & social capital  •  Enterprise social media use and employee well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic  •  Effects (both positive and negative) of digital and social media at workplace  •  Methodologies for studying digital and social media in enterprise   •  Organizational strategies and practices associated with digital and social media use  •  New theories to describe and explain the phenomenon of enterprise social media use  •  Roles and responsibilities of IS departments in the use of and support for digital and  social media  •  The use of social media for organizational fundraising or donations  •  The use of social media for public perception management  •  Social media fatigue during the COVID-19 pandemic  •  Social media use and work from home post the COVID-19 pandemic    [2] Marketing Plan.       Over the past nine years, this mini-track has made a steady progress in attracting quality  submissions. The three co-chairs of the mini-track have research expertise in research topics  covered in the proposed mini-track. In addition, the three co-chairs have served as track co-chairs  and mini-track co-chairs at various academic conferences, including HICSS and AMCIS. Our  detailed marketing plan includes:  •  Publish the mini-track call for paper to the established community of the 9-year-old mini- track.  •  Post the minitrack call for paper at the AISWorld Email List.  •  Market this mini-track at AMCIS, ACM SIGMIS and OCIS division of AOM Annual Meeting.  •  Explore options to edit a special issue of Information and Organization, in an effort to  fast track the best papers from this mini-track.

"HICSS-56","DSM","Digital and Social Media","1374fac0-7ac1-42dd-b0b7-0e78587cdddf","Games and Gaming","This minitrack provides researchers with an opportunity to present work on social aspects of digital games. The uniqueness of this minitrack is its focus on games and gaming, acknowledging that games can provide unusual and challenging analytical issues not found in other environments that may not have the same playful, perhaps semi-anonymous, focus on a game. Games research may call for multi-site, multi-method analysis not always found in other research areas and not only calls for deep understanding of theory and method but of games, gaming, and specific gaming environments. Given that G&G focuses on social elements, interactions, and structures, we envision digital games as socio-technical constructs. Submitted papers must contain a social dimension in the analysis or framing of digital games, examining, for example, sociability, social practices, communities (in-game, out-game, across multiple spaces or time), use of social affordances, or some other social dimension. With that in mind, the Games & Gaming minitrack will cover the following topics: Streaming gameplay (e.g., Twitch).  Network analysis of groups and communities in games.  Social affordances of games. Social practice (in-game, out-game, both). Player communities. Fans and fan communities. Community management. Toxicity online. Multiplayer games. Cooperative and competitive play. Esports. Fantasy sports leagues. Multigenerational play. Intercultural play. Game curation via sites like Steam. Virtual and augmented reality gaming. We are not interested in gamification or simulation of or for business processes, but may accept appropriate papers focused on simulations or the social aspects of gamification if they have a digital dimension to the work. Gamification focuses primarily on how to take existing processes and add game-like structures and frameworks to those processes. Gamification-related papers should be submitted to the Gamification minitrack in the Decision Analytics and Service Science track. In the Games and Gaming minitrack, we focus on items that are indeed games, and not a non-game item with gaming elements later added to it. Extended versions of accepted papers will be invited to be submitted to a Journal of Electronic Gaming and Esports (JEGE) special issue."

Modern streaming technology is a special delivery method of  different media (usually audio or video) from a server to a client and nowadays increasingly applied in the  entertainment and education industry (as an alternative to the conventional file download, or forms of  broadcasting). We differentiate between on-demand, or asynchronous streaming technology  (seen in e.g.,  Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, Youku), and live, or synchronous, streaming technology (seen in e.g., Twitch,  YouNow, Instagram Live, Taobao Live) and short-form video formats embedded in social media (e.g.,  TikTok, Snapchat, Kuaishou, or “Stories”-feature on Facebook or Instagram). On-demand streaming targets  a more consumption-oriented audience (with focus on passive entertainment), whereas live streaming offers  the possibility for active interaction between the users (which can lead to more active social exchange). With  the advent of social live streaming services (SLSSs), live-TV and social media merged. SLSSs include a  backchannel from the viewer to the streamer and among the viewers; they allow users to broadcast their  programs to everyone who wants to watch, all over the world. Some live streaming services employ elements  of gamification to motivate their users to continuously engage with the respective service. Furthermore, e- commerce live streaming and shopping services have joined the broad area of online marketing strategies.  However, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, streaming media has become even more popular,  creating new research opportunities.   Nowadays, live and on-demand streaming is an important aspect of digital and social media. However, the  research on this multifaceted topic is still developing. We possess only limited knowledge on this research  area, which can be examined through various different lenses such as media formats: audio (e.g., music,  podcasts) or video; content type: professionally produced content (e.g., Netflix, HBO, Disney Plus) or user- generated  content  (e.g., TikTok,  Twitch,  YouTube); the  technology  of  delivery:  asynchronous  (e.g.,  YouTube, Netflix) or synchronous (e.g., Twitch, YouNow); and through the lenses of the consumer or  producer (or even the merger of these two). In this minitrack we are looking for theoretical, conceptual,  and empirical papers investigating video streaming and audio streaming. Furthermore, we welcome  research fostering our understanding on the production and usage of, and user participation on, general social  live streaming services (e.g., Twitch and YouTube Live), embedded systems in other services (e.g.,  Instagram Live, niconico, and Facebook Live) and esports streaming and streamers (e.g., Twitch and  Douyu).  We  also  acknowledge  the  regional  differences  of  streaming  services’  popularity  and  their  development, and welcome research from various different regions (such as pioneering regions, e.g., Asia).  A new research approach related to regional and cultural aspects focuses on how to leverage live streaming  for the safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH), trying to maintain cultural diversity.    We anticipate submissions including (but not limited to) the following topics:  •  Information/content production and/or consumption behavior on streaming services  o  User participation and engagement on social streaming services (e.g., chatting, giving  “hearts,” commenting, donating)  o  Multichannel behavior  o  Social and community behavior on streaming services (e.g., parasocial interaction and  relationships)  •  The economy of streaming services and individual streamers   o  Professionalized and commercial strategies of streamers (e.g., influencers and micro- celebrities)  o  Business models and the economy of streaming services  o  Consumer behavior  o  Streaming e-commerce  •  Streaming technology and development  •  The role of streaming services in the dissemination of news and information (also misinformation)  •  Legal aspects of streaming (e.g., copyright or personality rights violations)  •  Organizational and institutional utilization of streaming  o  Streaming services and media in education and academia  •  Research on cultural and regional aspects of streaming services    Topics by types of media:  •  Live streaming  o  Social Live Streaming (e.g., YouNow, Inke)  o  Livestream function in other services (e.g., Facebook Live, IGTV, niconico)  o  eSports (e.g., Twitch, Douyu)  o  Audio (live radio, podcasts)  o  Audio discussion rooms (Clubhouse, Twitter Spaces)  o  e-Commerce (e.g., Taobao Live)  •  On-Demand streaming  o  User-generated video (e.g., YouTube, Youku Tudou) or  audio (e.g., SoundCloud)  o  Commercial video (e.g., Netflix, iQiyi) or audio (e.g., Spotify, Apple Music)  o  Learning/educational video (e.g., Udemy, Udacity)  •  Short-form video formats and vlogs in digital media  o  e.g., TikTok, Kuaishou  o  Instagram/Facebook stories  o  WhatsApp stories      Marketing plan:  •  Distribution of the CFP via lists/in the communities: ASIS&T (European (Student) Chapter, Social  Media Special Interest Group and possibly further Special Interest Groups)  •  Distribution of the CFP within the networks of the minitrack chairs (LinkedIn, Twitter, ResearchGate,  Facebook)  •  We have compiled a list of authors doing research in streaming technologies/entertainment (and who  published on this topic in the last 3-4 years) and will email them directly with the CFP (around 150  contacts)  •  We will send the CFP to colleagues from other institutions (e.g., Computer Science, LIS) with the  request to share it within their networks.

AISWorld and other listservs that we belong to will also be used. Furthermore, we will continue targeting Communication researchers, by circulating the CFP via the AoIR, ECREA, and other communication-centric listservs, sending the CFP to hand-picked researchers who participate in relevant NCA and ICA divisions, and reaching out to those who publish in Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication and in related communication journals. The details of the minitrack chair and co-chairs are at the bottom of the description, below.  Our organizations are aware of our involvement and provide the financial support that will allow at least one of us to attend HICSS every year.  Description: The Mediated Conversation minitrack focuses on the study of conversations taking place on digital and social media. Conversations are at the core of human communication.  Mediated conversations can use text, emoticons, audio, images, or video, or any combination thereof. The minitrack welcomes research on conversations that are interpersonal as well as those that occur via organizational or mass communication; involve journalistic, educational, or political contexts; or which appear in any other sphere of human activity, including the emerging interplay of human-machine communication. For details, see   This minitrack brings together researchers and innovators to explore mediated conversation and its implications; to raise new socio-technical, theoretical, ethical, pedagogical, linguistic, and social questions; and to suggest new methods, perspectives, and design approaches. The Mediated Conversation minitrack is the successor of the Persistent Conversation minitrack (established by Tom Erickson and Susan Herring at HICSS in 1999), which was originally focused on the novelty of conversational persistence. With the prevalence of mediated conversation, we are called upon to consider a wider field of issues. Examples of appropriate topics include but are not limited to: Innovation in mediated conversational practice The dynamics and analysis of large-scale conversation systems (e.g., MOOCs and big data applications) Methods for analyzing mediated conversation: qualitative, quantitative, data analytics, etc. Mediated collaboration The dark side of mediated conversation: e.g., loafing, incivility, hate speech, bullying, and communication overload Studies of virtual communities or other sites of mediated conversation Ethics and mediated conversation: privacy, deception, freedom of speech, security, and information warfare The role of mediated conversation in knowledge management The role of mediated conversation in organizations Domain-specific applications, opportunities, and challenges of mediated conversations and conversational exchanges (e.g., in education, healthcare, social movements, government, citizen participation, management, and news media) Conversation visualizations and analytics The role of listeners, lurkers, and silent interactions Novel properties of mediated conversation A platform’s role in mediating the conversation Power dynamics and conversational patterns among users of social media The role of conversation in understanding the interplay between media producers and media audiences Human-machine communication and related conversations (e.g., chatbots) Fast-track journal opportunity: Authors of papers accepted for presentation in the minitrack will be offered the opportunity to submit an extended version of their papers for consideration for fast-track publication in the ACM journal ACM Transaction on Social Computing ()  Short bios: Seth C.

Network analysis reveals the underlying structure and the dynamic interactions among system components. Network science and the development of digital and social media have co-evolved as catalysts of each other’s advancement, and the increased use of social and digital media provides scientists with a wealth of precise and novel data.   We welcome submissions that represent insightful ways that network analysis can be used to better understand social and digital media. Both methodologically and theoretically driven papers are encouraged, as well as empirical research (e.g. telecommunication, health, website specific, international, organizational, etc.) that push the boundaries of network science as applied to social and digital media. Forward-thinking and boundary-spanning forms of research including, but not limited to, the study of multi-level, localized and ego-centric networks are welcome.

Research on social network analysis is conducted in a wide range of sciences, and as such it is necessary to attract scholars from different fields to share methodological advances and establish theoretical parallels.  The science of network analysis has progressed in parallel with the use of social and digital media. The precise measurement of communicative flows has been a challenge, and the increased use of social media to manage communicative interaction has provided social network scientists with a wealth of precise and novel data. Further, the increased analytic representation and theoretical understanding of new media and information systems provides developers with improved insights into the uses of technology to manage the resources embedded in their social networks.   Digital and social media have provided precise measures of social networks. From social networking sites (e.g. Facebook), to microblogging networks (e.g. Twitter) and global cooperation networks (e.g. Wikipedia), the material and nonmaterial exchanges of individuals and larger social systems are being recorded and largely retrievable, presenting social network researchers with powerful new data. There are four main implications of having access to digital and social media data. First, we now have access to measurements of network relations that are more reliable than in the past. Second, the nature of the relational data is unique, allowing for the analytical exploration of network structures in ways that are pushing the boundaries of the science. Third, analysis of network evolution is increasingly possible since much of the data available through social media is dynamic (a historically persistent challenge when collecting network data). Fourth, dynamic network data has contributed to visualization methods that allow for the animation of social networks.  Examples of scholars that the Network Analysis of Digital and Social Media mini-track will continue to attract are:  Organizational and business school scholars that use network analysis in their research, specifically those that are collecting network data from social media and networks of online coordination.  World systems and international relations scholars who analyze the global flow of information through social and digital media. Communication scholars that study the structure of both ego-centered and complete communication network data, and who are researching information technologies that allow for network analysis Computer systems scholars that are interested in networks of information flow in social media Health science researchers who use digital and social media to explore behavioral health outcomes by applying network theories and analyses  Marketing of the Network Analysis of Digital and Social Media minitrack will take place via distributed messages amongst organizational listserves and newsletters in the fields of Social Network Analysis, Communication, Information Science, Management, Organizational Behavior, World Systems Research, and other fields as seen appropriate.   It is of note that one of the minitrack chairs, George Barnett, is the former president of the International Network of Social Network Analysis (INSNA), which will provide us with a key organizational connection to researchers who are already associated with this field of study. Additionally, all minitrack chairs are well connected and organizationally involved in the major Communication and New Media associations.    We have been running this minitrack in some form at HICSS for over 10 years, and although we have usually programmed 1 or 2 panel sessions for this, the room is always full and the dialogue is excellent. It is interesting to note that we have been successful at attracting authors at the absolute highest level in the field. We expect to be able to continue the quality and reach.  3) Parallel Conference Activity:   Many of the parallel conference and publications relevant to HICSS have mirrored the interest in social networks. Examples of conferences that have included sessions related to the proposed minitrack are; several ACM conferences such as Hypertext and Hypermedia, WWW, SIGWEB, SIGSPATIAL, SIGKDD, the SIGAPP Conference on Computational Aspects of Social Networks, and SIGCHI, IEEE conferences such as the International Conference on Advances in Social Network Analysis and Data Mining, the International Workshop on Network Science For Communication Networks at the upcoming INFOCOM Conference on Computer Communications. In addition to the ACM and IEEE conferences, several national and international conferences have had sessions on communication networks such as the National Communication Association, the International Communication Association, the American Sociological Association, the International Conference on the Design of Cooperative Systems, and the INSNA Sunbelt Conference.  HICSS continues to be uniquely positioned to bring together scientists from across many different fields to discuss the application of network analysis to digital and social media, and to understand how the approach can inform their own form of systems science. Systems are at core of network science, and it is appropriate that there continues to be a minitrack specifically for Network Analysis at HICSS, since it is one of the foremost forums for interaction of scientists interested in systems and technology.  4) Our organizations endorse our involvement and will pay for our travel and registration cost to attend HICSS."

With accelerated speed there are more and more websites tapping into the ‘wisdom of crowds’ as a source of information that influences our everyday decision-making. The internet has revolutionised the manner in which individuals obtain the information they need to make decisions. Using OSN can accelerate or decelerate the DM process for both individuals and communities through the accessing of data from multiple sources. While ample independent research exists on OSN and DM, there is a lack of research into how online technology affects the making of decisions that have an impact on our lives. How do we use OSN in our most important everyday decision-making? The synergy of these themes provides a unique research perspective from which to take a fresh look at both DM research and the actual process of DM as it is affected by the use of OSN. The main purpose of this mini track is to explore and extend, as well as challenge, existing knowledge of OSN and DM. We hope to: ● Understand and ascertain whether OSN can support and empower users in their decision-making process and particular phases; ● Identify and conceptualise new phases (if any) in the decision-making process that is integral to OSN conversations; ● Explore the structure and sequence of decision-making phases arising out of the use of OSN ● Identify biases, strengths and weaknesses of the human psyche that could be attenuated and/or enhanced through appropriate design of OSN for decision-making ● Seek practical guidelines for the design of OSN that support blended decision-making processes that leverages the wisdom of crowds We welcome conceptual, theoretical, and empirical papers that enrich our understanding of this. All methodological approaches are welcome.  Topics of interest include but are not limited to: ● Decision Making in OSN ● The impact of OSN on Decision Making ● Types of OSN for Decision Making ● Decision Support in OSN ● Typology of Users of OSN for Decision Making ● Traditional and New Decision Models and Theories in OSN ● Biases in OSN for Decision Making ● Online vs Offline Decision Making ● Structure of Decisions in OSN ● Phases of Decision Making Processes in OSN ● Decision Making Governance, Risk, and Compliance in OSN ● OSN Security and Privacy ● Decision Making Processes and Systems ● Apps, Tools and Technologies for Decision Making ● A particular focus is on Health and Financial OSN Mini-track Chairs: Valeria Sadovykh Dr. Valeria SadovykhworksforaglobalconsultingfirmasatechnologyconsultantbasedinNewYork.

Semi-structured digital records, like emails, and unstructured text, like social media posts, present a significant threat of privacy breaches. The enormity of data presents an uphill task to identify and mitigate private information on digital and social media platforms. While AI-powered privacy solutions are a welcomed step, it is only recently that researchers have focused on more human-centered and transdisciplinary (Polk, 2015) digital privacy solutions. Privacy protection is a legal and ethical responsibility of both public and private sector organizations, and AI development and deployment should account for the diversity of the target audience, the cultural contexts, and extant biases (Ehsan et al., 2021). Privacy solutions should not only be effective and accurate, but also human-centered and accountable (Hepenstal et al., 2019). [Minitrack Goals] This minitrack aims to attract submissions on digital privacy solutions that bring different disciplines together, especially computer science,systemsciences, informationscience, social science, and law. The focus of this minitrack is to bridge the gap between algorithmic development(automateddecision-makingsystems, fair,accountable,and transparentsystems) and human-centered approaches (usability studies, surveys, user interviews). We encourage submissions that address privacy concerns in digital and social media through inter- and trans-disciplinary approaches, including but not limited to AI and ML. This minitrack hypothesizes that the user confidence and trust in automated systems can be improved byhuman-in-the-loopresearch approaches.By understanding theprivacybehaviour and needs of users in digital and social media, and inspecting the legal and cultural factors that transcend such behavior, we can design robust systems that are acceptable, trustworthy, and efficient. [Potential Submissions] Potential submissions for this minitrack should address (but are not limited) the following research topics: ● quantitative, qualitative, and computational studies ondigital(e.g., images,webpages, emails, websites) and social media (e,g,, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, TikTok, Weibo) privacy; ● qualitative studies using interviews, surveys, and usability studies to identify privacy behavior of users (when using digital and social media); ● quantitative work on digital privacy using statistical analysis; ● machine and deep learning approaches to identify, classify, and mitigate sensitiveand private information on digital and social media platforms; ● novel privacy solutions using explainable AI, transparent ML algorithms, or any interdisciplinary methods.

It is being driven on the one side by technical advances in  a number of areas such as machine learning, neural nets and deep learning and on the other  by economic forces as many governments continue to try to provide ever more services with  ever fewer resources. AI offers enormous potential to reduce the cost of (for example)  delivering personalised and customised services to citizens. On the other hand, machines are  not accountable and there are opaque and proprietary black boxes already being used to  make decisions that can have fundamental effects of the lives of ordinary citizens. While many  government agencies identify AI as a priority, the successful diffusion of this innovation has  not been realised on a large scale.       The  focus  of  this  mini  track  will  be  on  both  current  uses  and  potential  uses  of  AI  in  government.  We  invite  contributions  on  adoption  and  implementation  of  AI  in  public  organizations, the benefits and risks as well as on the control, regulation and governance of  this technology. While we envisage papers in this track being on the use of AI being primarily  on its use in public administration, the mini track will also welcome papers in areas and on  topics which come within the wider public sector such as policing and health. It will, however,  exclude areas such as national security and the military.  We are also open to considering  papers that look at the regulation of AI more generally. Amongst the dimensions of AI in  government that might be addressed are:    •  Governance of AI and algorithms generally  •  Risk management and legal issues  •  Emerging technologies and their implications  •  Bias and Ethics   •  Controlling AI  •  Societal and organizational implications  •  Impacts on public governance  •  Economics  •  Privacy  •  Transparency  •  Accountability  •  Explainability  •  Outsourcing of AI  •  Trust in AI  •  Determinants of AI adoption   •  Challenges of AI implementation        We welcome submissions with diverse views and methodologies. The goal of this mini track  is to promote critical discussion on the current status and future trajectory AI in  government.     Minitrack papers should be submitted online via the HICSS submission system by June 15,  2022 (11:59 pm HST).

Digital	Government	(e-Government)	focuses	on	value	delivery	to	 citizens	through	information	and	communication	technology	(ICT)	support	for	processes,	activities	 and	resources,	from	different	public	organizations.	Hence,	interoperability	in	the	context	of	e- Government	is	of	critical	importance	to	link	and	integrate	processes	and	services	sharing	data	from	 organizations	to	deliver	better	public	services	to	citizens.	Many	efforts	have	been	carried	out	in	the	 last	decades	to	support	interoperability	within	e-Government	settings,	including	the	definition	and	 introduction	of	several	interoperability	frameworks	and	platforms	in	countries	and	continents,	such	 as	the	European	Interoperability	Framework.	Interoperability	is	not	only	provided	by	technical	 means,	semantic	or	syntactic	interoperability,	but	also	thanks	to	business-oriented	approaches	 supporting	organizational	interoperability,	such	as	Business	Process	Management	(BPM).		 	 BPM	constitutes	a	real	asset	for	enhancing	the	services	of	an	organization	and	their	coordination,	 as	well	as	the	products	that	each	actor	of	a	virtual	network	delivers	to	meet	clients’	expectations	 (citizens,	patients,	etc.).	The	BPM	lifecycle	embraces	several	phases	that	aim	for	a	continuous	 process	improvement,	including	process	discovery	and	modeling,	process	mining	and	analysis,	 process	re-design,	process	enactment	and	monitoring.	Collaborative	organizations	need	ways	to	 define	and	provide	support	for	their	inter-organizational	collaborative	processes,	in	order	to	 interact	with	each	other	in	an	easier,	more	secure	and	more	adequate	way,	ensuring	the	quality	of	 the	results	to	the	internal	and	the	external	users.	This	support	must	fulfill	both	centralized	and	 decentralized	scenarios	depending	on	the	domain	and	the	organizations	involved,	including	the	 integration	of	their	existing	software	and	information	systems	for	the	exchange	of	data	and	the	 execution	of	business	functions.	 	 Digital	 government’s	 collaborative	 processes	 involve	 organizations	 (employees,	 technologies),	 partners	(providers,	consumers),	and	users	(citizens,	foreigners),	leading	to	complex	interactions	 within	different	e-Government	models	and	available	technologies.	These	interactions	can	take	place	 within	two	main	scenarios:	(i)	closed,	in	which	interactions	between	organizations	are	explicitly	 defined	and	already	agreed	as	collaborative	business	processes;	or	(ii)	open,	in	which	organizations	 offer	capabilities	for	integration,	not	explicitly	agreeing	on	their	processes	but	mostly	on	the	 capabilities	 they	 provide	 or	 require	 to	 participate	 in	 the	 collaboration	 (like	 payment,	 event	 awareness,	security,	process	monitoring	and	analysis,	open	data,	integration	with	social	networks,	 and	prediction).	Moreover,	the deployment of a BPM approach in a sensitive e-Government context  often faces critical barriers, such as change management and a potential discouragement when it  comes to modeling complex organizational behaviors.	 	 Successful	 inter-organizational	 collaborative	 process	 management	 within	 e-Government	 organizations	will	lead	to	better	conceptual	and	technological	integration,	not	only	with	each	other	 but	also	with	citizens	and	users	in	general.	To	this	end,	it	is	necessary	to	devise	new	ways	to	deal	 with	the	complexity	of	e-Government	collaborative	process	definition,	modeling,	mining,	analysis,	 enactment,	monitoring	and	improvement	from	various	dimensions	and	points	of	view	including	 theory,	engineering,	interoperability,	agility,	social	aspects,	etc.	Several	aspects	for	the	definition	and	 treatment	of	business	processes	in	e-Government	settings	have	to	be	taken	into	account,	such	as	 process	data	registration	and	collection,	data	integration,	data	quality	and	data	transparency,	 interoperability	to	support	the	interaction	within	participant	organizations	with	heterogeneous	 technologies,	software	and	information	systems.	Emerging	elements	pose	new	challenges	when	 applied	and/or	providing	support	for	e-Government	business	processes,	such	as	AI-enabled	BPM,	 blockchain	and	IoT	settings	for	BPM,	Green	BPM	and	process	sustainability,	and	more	recently	for	 COVID-19	processes	and	e-health	services.

Marketing plan for the mini-track    Our marketing plan is mainly based on the different communities we have been involved in for  years now, both in Europe and Latin America.    The  Latin  American  Computing  Conference  (CLEI)  this  year  in  its  48th  edition  (https://clei2022.uniquindio.edu.co/)  will be held in Armenia, Colombia, is published by IEEE since  2012  and  brings  together  researchers  from  all  over  Latin  America,  Spain  and  Portugal  (http://www.clei.org/cd2018-2020/). CLEI is one of the most important computing conference in  Latin American, as well as the CLEI community. Delgado was Uruguay’s representative in the period  2016-2020, general chair of CLEI 2014 (in Montevideo) and general program chair of CLEI 2021  (Cartago, Costa Rica), and Astudillo was Chile’s representative until 2016, was general chair of CLEI  2016 (in Valparaíso), and is secretary of CLEI Executive Committee 2021-2023. Delgado and  Astudillo are regular contributors as author and decision makers in the CLEI conference and  community. Delgado, Astudillo and García integrates the steering committee of the SLPNASO track  of  CLEI  (https://www.uniquindio.edu.co/clei2022/publicaciones/1200/simposios/).  The  CLEI  mailing lists allow CFP dissemination to most Latin American countries and researches.     It is worth mentioning that Latin America has been betting on digital government improvement, led  by Uruguay as the only Latin American country in the Leading countries in the UN-E-Government  Survey 2018 (https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/en-us/Reports/UN-E-Government-Survey- 2018). Chile is also a leading country in the Latin American e-Government area.    García is an active researcher in Spain, and Delgado and Astudillo have links to many Spanish uni- versities and researches. He participated as chair of the Doctoral symposium at the18th edition of the  International Conference on Business Process Management (BPM 2020) held in virtual format in  Seville (Spain) (https://congreso.us.es/bpm2020/). This conference is the premium forum for re- searchers and practitioners in BPM. García and Delgado’s contacts in the BPM community include  well-known names like Prof. Barbara Weber and Prof. Hajo Reijers, with whom we will work in  engaging the BPM community by dissemination in the mailing lists and contacts. The national Span- ish Conference of the Society of Software Engineering and Software Development Technologies  (https://sistedes2022.spilab.es/) is the most important venue for Spanish researchers in which García  participate  actively,  integrates  the  steering  committee  of  the  JCIS  track  (https://sistedes2022.spilab.es/jcis/ ), and the mailing list will also serve to disseminate the minitrack.

Information Technology has become pervasive in all aspects of our lives. The minitrack examines aspects associated with the security of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) used by governments and critical infrastructures and explores ways that IT can enhance the ability of governments to ensure the safety and security of its citizens.  Of especial interest are systems such as industrial control systems, SCADA, and process control networks which control infrastructures that include electricity (Smartgrid), pipelines, chemical plants, manufacturing, traffic control and more.   Governments have also embraced IT to interface with citizens in a more efficient manner. Security issues have risen to the forefront as a result of data disclosures and identity theft incidents discussed in mainstream media. Other issues include intellectual property theft and criminal acts involving computers. Recently, the issue of cybersecurity information sharing has also risen in importance and much has been written and debated on this subject. Issues surrounding the common need for security, while the authority to defend and ownership of the assets may reside in different entities. In the US, most critical infrastructure is privately owned, but regulated by government – how does this affect cybersecurity efforts. The challenges and questions in the policy space are significant, with plenty of room for significant research.  This mintrack explores research into pressing issues surrounding the intersection of cybersecurity and government spheres of influence. Whether technical or policy, from information sharing to new analytical methods of detection of insider threats, this minitrack casts a wide net to bring cross disciplinary thinking to problems with far-reaching implications.   This is a wide focus minitrack, if your research involves security associated with IT or OT, and has a government component, then this is its home. Topics include, but are not limited to:  Systems for governments to respond to security events  Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP)  Cyber physical systems security  Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and control systems  Election Security Cybersecurity issues during a crisis such as a pandemic Information assurance and trusted Computing  Information sharing  Information security economics  Information warfare  Incident response  New threats, including insider and nation states  Digital forensics  Privacy and freedom of information  Security management  Laws and regulation of IT security  Security concerns of new technologies  Cybersecurity in government disaster recovery and business continuity  Case reports related to security experiences within government   Marketing Plan  	This minitrack has been successfully operating for over a decade.  During that time we have built up a group of researchers who regularly attend as well as regularly submit publications for consideration.  The Minitrack chairs have built up a list of individuals who we send information to on the conference who we also ask to share with their colleagues.  We also send information on the conference and the mini-track to departments in academic institutions that have security programs.  Additionally, when conferences were attended in person, flyers were taken to other conferences to advertise the HICSS conference and the call for proposals.  Minitrack Co-Chairs:  Wm. Arthur Conklin  (I will be the lead this year) University of Houston  I have sufficient funding to attend – and look forward to a return to in-person HICSS! Gregory B.

Disaster	Information,	Resilience,	for	Emergency	and	Crisis	Technologies.	           Frederick Benaben  Julie Dugdale  Andrea Tapia  Mihoko Sakurai  Elsa Negre  Overview	 The main objective of this minitrack is to focus on how technologies, information management, data  sciences and artificial intelligence can contribute to support the role of governments and emergency  management of public value purpose. This topic stems from the following considerations.  The evolution and progress of our civilizations have brought our world into a state of hyper-connection,  hyper-density and hyper-concentration which has, little by little, completely erased all the spaces of  physical, organizational or structural absorption. Yet, these spaces were likely to limit the expansion  of critical situations, thus preventing the number, the amplitude and the repercussions of crises. This  statement of fact and the responsibility it highlights, not necessarily for humans but at least for the  development of the human species, with respect to the frequency, gravity and propagation of the  crises that affect our planet, reciprocally underlines the need for our species to take charge of  managing these crises. It is therefore fundamentally on all the questions relating to the handling of  these missions by the governance structures (whether they are global, continental, national, regional  or local) that this DIRECT minitrack wishes to address: The serious challenges facing government in  cities, regions and nations of the world relate to acute shocks (e.g. forest fires, floods, earthquakes,  tsunamis, pandemics and terrorist attacks) and chronic stresses (e.g. high unemployment, religious  extremism, inefficient public transport, endemic violence, chronic shortages of food and water).  Information is among the key life-supporting essentials in a disaster response, as well as water and  basic foods which are vital to sustain lives. Above all, the recent pandemics, environmental changes,  geopolitical tensions have shown how information (about contamination, about root causes, about  trust, about stocks, about science and progress) could be at the heart of the crisis management.  Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has, and will continue to profoundly change,  disaster management in years to come. This, coupled with the impressive recent advances in artificial  intelligence, offers huge potential for better management of crisis situations. Data and information  management also guides us to build a disaster-resilient community which can adapt the society to  those  unexpected  events.  These  issues  should  be  tackled  at  each  level  of  the  governance  (international, national, regional, local, etc.), and with regards to all relevant dimensions (social,  technological, interoperability, agility, etc.).  We invite papers that deal with any aspect of the analysis, design, development, deployment,  implementation, integration, operation, use or evaluation of ICT for crisis management, and resilient  communities, especially in the perspective of discussing the roles of government and governance  structures.  Papers  may  address  any  phase  in  the  disaster  management  cycle:  Prevention  and  mitigation;  preparedness;  alert;  response;  recovery;  and  post  disaster. In  addition,  we  support  innovative and break-through visions regarding these topics.

Through social media, mobile applications, online services, and other forms of digital services, governments are increasingly expecting that individuals will interact with them through a range of digital media and technologies.  This includes public policy-making (e.g., governance), government operations (e.g. emergency management), citizen engagement (e.g. transparency), and government services (e.g., information provision).  As governments closed their physical locations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, digital services and resources were the primary, if not only, means through which individuals could engage with their governments.  The pandemic highlighted the disparities that various populations, particularly marginalized groups, and governments face in achieving a vision of digital government for all.   As governments promote digital pathways, it is critical for governments to ensure that all citizens are able to realize their needs through inclusive design, availability, and ability. However, many digital divides remain – from access to sufficient technologies (e.g., broadband, devices, costs), the ability to use technologies, and the design of digital government services.  This minitrack focuses on digital inclusion within digital government services. The minitrack includes (but is not limited to) topics such as: This includes, but is not limited to: Impacts of the COVID-19 on the ability of marginalized groups to engage with digital government; The development of inclusive digital government; Longitudinal analyses of inclusion in digital government; The role of digital literacy in use/non-use of online government services; The use of digital government by immigrant and migrant populations; The use of digital government by indigenous populations; The use of digital government by low-literacy populations; The role of socio-economic status on the use of digital government; Accessibility of digital government for people with perceptual, motor, or cognitive disabilities; The role of government in the development of international technical standards for digital accessibility; The role of community-based organizations (e.g., public libraries, non-government organizations) in fostering digital inclusion;  Development and/or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies related to digital inclusion; Trends in case law related to digital inclusion; Trends in comparative or international law related to digital inclusion; The relationship between trust of institutions and use of digital government by diverse populations; How digital-based voting impacts involvement of citizens in elections LGBTQ interactions with digital government; Usability evaluation methods for testing digital government services with diverse user populations; Research methods for understanding why diverse individuals avoid using digital government; and, Inclusive design methods to involve diverse populations in the actual development of digital government.  Marketing plan: If the proposed mini-track is accepted, we plan to market it to multiple communities to which we belong, including: electronic government, human-computer interaction, accessibility, disability rights law, information policy, library science, and ICT4D.

Specifically, this track seeks papers that discuss theories and/or present cases useful to better understand how different e-government policies and or strategies can lead to successful e-government deployments or, on the other hand, to the factors which may lead to failure of such projects. Papers which examine or discuss external or contextual factors that affect or influence digital government, such as the political state; organizational culture; institutional factors or normative arrangements are also invited. By digital government action, we mean both macro-level institutional designs and micro-level collaboration and competition between diverse stakeholders.  While there is already a body of literature on best practice for e-government deployments, there are significant gaps in this existing literature and new and emerging technologies, not to mention new thinking about public administration and government itself, often demand new ways of thinking and innovative approaches to frame these deployments. In the pandemic and post-pandemic recovery, these new demands become increasingly important as digital technologies provide new opportunities and challenges for adaptive and agile governance have also impacted the way by which public administration’s processes and activities are structured and executed. Papers which address these challenges are particularly welcome this year.  In addition, the minitrack welcomes contributions exploring the issues associated with the design and implementation of policies and strategies that change the nature of the interactions between government and citizens, private sector organizations, and NGOs. Moreover, papers that discuss the political, institutional and organisational implication of the deployment of emerging and disruptive technologies are particularly welcomed.  We invite papers on the following topics, but not limited to:  Best practices for digital governance using innovative practices Cases of e-government platforms design, implementation and management Digital by default and its implications Digital innovation strategies for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals  Digital public administration strategies Digital technologies impacts on policy-making E-justice and ethics of digital innovations in the public sector  E-Participation and E-democracy policies and strategies E-Procurement policies and strategies ICT for development strategies ICT for efficiency and effectiveness in government action ICT mediated co-creation and co-production ICT related outsourcing in the public sector ICT, transparency and accountability Interoperability policies: legal, organizational, semantic, and technical layers Legal and judicial transformation associated with ICTs deployments Lessons for digital policy from the pandemic of 2019-2022. National and global digital strategies to respond to a pandemic  Privacy and data protection policies and strategies Public health versus privacy concerns  Public policy issues in digital government Quantitative and qualitative analyse of the impact of digital government policies and strategies Socio-political, institutional, organisational and ethical impacts of disruptive technologies Strategies to manage design and deployment of innovative technologies  We are looking for high-quality conference papers that adopt a wide range of approaches on content, case studies, or practical and theoretical models to advance the knowledge related to the design, implementation, and management of strategies on policies in the e-government context. The papers submitted to this minitrack must be new and unpublished.

This  transformation,  which  has  become  a  top  priority  for  many  cities  and  other  local  governments, offers great promise for improved well-being and prosperity but, also, poses  significant challenges at the complex intersection of technology and society.     A  smart  and  connected  community  can  be  conceptualized  as  one  that  synergistically  integrates  intelligent  technologies  with  the  natural  and  built  environments,  including  infrastructure, to improve the social, economic, and environmental well-being of those who  live,  work,  or  travel  within  it.  Building  on  the  notion  of  community  informatics,  smart  communities can be seen as enabling and empowering citizens and supporting the individual  and communal quests for well-being.    Although the literature is rich in references to smart cities and communities, this is still a  developing and fuzzy concept due to its multidimensional and multifaceted aspect that goes  beyond the mere use of technology and infrastructure. Although technology is a necessary  condition  to  become  smart,  it  is  not  the  only  aspect  that  defines  smart  cities  and  communities. Novel studies are indicating that emerging technologies have a huge influence  on social life, catalyzing new needs of citizens and transforming the way they are addressed,  influencing people’s ability to exercise their “right to the city/community” and impacting on  social  sustainability  on  several  levels.  City  administration  and  community  management,  information integration, data quality, privacy and security, institutional arrangements, and  citizen participation are therefore some of the issues that need greater attention to make a  community smarter today and in the near future.     Nonetheless, the literature on smart cities and communities is fragmented, particularly in  terms of the strategies that different cities and communities should follow in order to  become smarter. What most of the literature does agree on is that there is no single way to  becoming smart and different communities have adopted different approaches that reflect  their  particularities.  In  addition,  the  advent  of  emerging  technologies  such  as  artificial  intelligence, open government, open data, big data, blockchain, chatbots and so on, have  opened new avenues for smart governance in the urban and communities’ contexts, which  fosters new research on this area.    This mini track aims at exploring these issues, paying particular attention to the challenges of  smart  cities  and  smart  communities  as  well  as  to  the  impact  of  these  initiatives  to  understand how new technologies can shape the social sustainability, the livability of local  communities, and the wellbeing of its residents. It also focuses on the orchestrated interplay  and balance of smart governance practices, smart public administration, smart communities,  smart resources and talent leverage in urban, rural, and regional spaces facilitated by novel  uses of ICT and other technologies.    As a result, areas of focus and interest to this mini track include, but are not limited, to the  following topics:  -  Taxonomies of smart cities and communities   -  Smart governance as the foundation to creating smart urban and regional spaces  (elements, prerequisites, and principles of smart governance)  -  Smart cities and smart government (focal areas, current practices, cases, and  potential pitfalls)  -  Smart partnerships (triple/quadruple/quintuple helix, public-private partnerships,  and citizen participation)  -  The impact of digital transformation on the change of citizens’ role in the city  -  Smart cities, communities and regions (cases, rankings, comparisons, and critical  success factors)  -  Benefits of the impact of emerging technologies on citizens and local communities  -  Collective intelligence for smart cities and communities  -  Emerging technologies in smart cities and communities (artificial intelligence, big  data, open data, open government, social media and networks, chatbots, etc.)  -  Smart governance in cities and communities in the age of the emerging technologies  -  Management of smart cities and communities  -  Outcomes of smart cities and communities  -  The role of digital technologies in both increasing community livability and improving  social sustainability and inequalities  -  Smart services  -  Urban-rural gaps in smart communities  -  Resilience and sustainability capacities in smart cities and communities.  -   Innovative solutions for smart cities and communities  -  Building knowledge societies for smart cities and communities  -  Smart cities and communities and their contribution to the Sustainable Development  Goals (SDGs)     Marketing plan    All digital government’s mini tracks call for papers are posted on the digital government  track chair’s webpage. Additionally, the call for papers will be posted on several websites  (such our organizations’). We will also send the call for papers to several digital government  networks, send personal invitations to colleagues, and will use social media to disseminate it  (in particular, Twitter and LinkedIn).

The Digital Government Reference Library contains more than 11,000 peer-reviewed publications. This multi-, cross- and even inter-disciplinary study domain benefits from researchers and practitioners from diverse fields, including but not limited to public administration, information systems, information science, and political science. As the domain matures, there is a need to further elaborate on and contribute to new theoretical approaches and models with a potential to frame studies in the field. To this end, several key questions emerge: Given the applied nature of digital government, what can be the role of theories? What are the fundamental theoretical contributions to or from the digital government discipline, if any? Does the field have any foundational theoretic frameworks? Given its multi-, cross- and even inter-disciplinary nature, does the field need to develop its own set of theories and in that case which and how? What is the appropriate balance of theory and practice in this domain of study? What are the reference disciplines for digital government, if any? Does digital government have, or shall digital government have, a “home” (anchor) discipline?  Is digital government (can, or shall, it evolve into) its own discipline? What relevance does the digital government body of knowledge have to practice? What are the roles of values and norms in the development of Digital Government Theories? How locally contextualised processes affect development and application of Digital Government theories? The overall purpose of this mini-track is to explore the role of theory development in the field of digital government. We welcome submissions with diverse views on the role of theory development in digital government to promote critical discussion of the current status and future trajectory of the discipline. Potential topics include, but are not limited to: Fundamental Digital Government Theories The Future of Digital Government Research Digital Government Theory Development The Role of Theory Development and Theory Integration in Digital Government The Status of the Digital Government Domain (discipline, or not?)

Advanced technologies will require sophisticated methods for understanding how they can be incorporated into increasingly complex and dynamic infrastructure.  We invite papers that examine issues of reliability, security, and resilience of interconnected power systems, including testbeds that will demonstrate the robustness of advanced technologies, and the associated computational and communication challenges associated with operating the power system. Session 1:  Grid Reinforcement, Testbeds and Synthetic Networks Session Organizers and Co-Chairs:  Mladen Kezunovic (kezunov@ece.tamu.edu) and Mert Korkali (korkali1@llnl.gov) The combined cascading failure of electricity and other infrastructure networks greatly increases the discomfort, safety, and economic loss to society. There are considerable challenges in modeling and coordinating the important interactions (possibly including human, market, or economic factors) and quantifying the adverse interactions so that their risk can be estimated, mitigated and controlled. It is also important to verify and quantify these interactions in large-scale testbeds. An essential part of the testbed design is creation of synthetic networks of various infrastructures that allow the scale and complexity to be faithfully represented allowing evaluation of novel robust solutions. Methods for reinforcing networks through hardening the physical components or offering distributed energy resources (DER) as network support are of interest as well. The objective of this session is to describe new methods to analyze and quantify electric, gas, communications or water network outages and their interactions with each other so that they can be better mitigated. Novel test approaches that are enabling physical and virtual testing of the interactions, as well as large scale synthetic networks that are creating realistic test environment are needed. Papers describing new approaches to modeling and testing complex infrastructure failures in the context of complex systems, complex networks, and probabilistic analyses of cascades among interacting networks are encouraged. Papers using testbeds should state the hypotheses being tested and discuss the conclusions about the hypotheses’ validation. Joint papers from multiple organizations that have federated testbed facilities or are working on development of synthetic networks are welcome. (Expect 3 to 4 papers in this session) Session 2:  Data Analytics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Session Organizers and Co-Chairs: Le Xie (le.xie@tamu.edu) and Xiao Chen (chen73@llnl.gov) The electric power system is a safety-critical infrastructure system. Operators now have an unprecedented wealth of data from a variety of sources such as demand response participants, synchrophasors, and enhanced SCADA systems.  If managed properly, this data can provide opportunities to increase the efficiency, reliability, and overall performance of the power system.  With the increased adoption of grid modernization, demand response programs, and distributed generation that is often renewable, intermittent, and stochastic, system operators need to manage vast amounts of data in the presence of data inaccuracy and system uncertainties.  This introduces new opportunities for various artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies including probabilistic AI/ML. This session invites technical papers presenting new approaches, methods, and applications related to data analytics including AI/ML that advances the state of the art for safety-critical applications in planning, designing, operating and protecting electric power systems. This session will address challenges and opportunities associated with big data coming from a variety of sources such as behavior data in demand response, synchrophasors, weather, and enhanced control and other data acquisition systems.

Innovations that focus on recent developments in the area of large-scale dynamics and control for power systems and on distributed decision and control concepts for generation, storage, and loads are specifically sought for this year’s program. Session 1: Large Scale Dynamics and Control  Session Organizer and Session Chairs – Mani Venkatasubramanian (mani@eecs.wsu.edu) and John Pierre (pierre@uwyo.edu) The power system is a large-scale nonlinear system consisting of hundreds of dynamic components including synchronous generators and their controls, nonlinear loads, and complex power electronic devices such as those found in wind generators and flexible transmission controllers. Modeling and simulation of the underlying large-scale differential-algebraic equations are essential for understanding fundamental questions in power system planning and operations. Recent measurement based real-time monitoring and control algorithms are providing a renewed look at the dynamic phenomena of the interconnected power system through synchronized wide-area measurements in the form of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and Synchronized point-on-wave measurement devices. With the availability of such large-scale synchronized measurements in the power system today, there is an urgent need to combine model-based power system dynamic research and measurement based monitoring and control algorithms towards advancing real-time operational reliability of electric power grids. Increased presence of grid following and grid forming inverter based renewable generation sources requires new analytical methods for their control, integration, coordination and protection. This session will showcase recent developments in the area of large-scale dynamic research in the power system area. (Expect 3 to 4 papers in this session) Session 2: Distributed Decision and Control  Session Organizer and Chair: Judy Cardell (jcardell@email.smith.edu) and Felipe Wilches-Bernal (fwilche@sandia.gov) Electric power systems are currently transitioning from centralized power production towards more decentralized power generation. This transition is partially driven by the advent of renewable energy resources such as solar and wind, and by technologies such as energy storage and controllable loads. In addition to being more dispersed, newer technologies tend to be interfaced with the grid by power-electronics inverters which gives them the ability to provide grid services with appropriate control strategies. These changes call for new control techniques to exploit the potential of distributed resources in enhancing the operations of the electric grid. Distributed control approaches considered in this session will range from protection schemes at the very fast time scales of microseconds to short-term operations and planning decisions at larger time scales. The papers in this session will present new control theory, tools and testbeds for controlling large-scale energy infrastructure using diverse actuating resources such as distributed generation, controllable loads and energy storage systems. They will address the fundamental obstacles to generalizable methodologies for controlling large-scale complex engineered systems while economically and reliably achieving evolving local and global performance objectives."
"HICSS-56","ES","Electric Energy Systems","95c5564d-cc41-4458-bd18-bc1a315c4030","Resilient Networks","Public concerns about the adverse environmental and health effects of using fossil fuels and nuclear power to generate electricity have led to a greater reliance on renewable sources of generation that are inherently variable and uncertain. This trend is accompanied by increased proliferation of distributed resources, storage and smart grid technologies that facilitate demand response and greater observability of the grid. As a result the electric power industry faces new challenges in planning and operation of the power system that require new market mechanisms, computational optimization tools and innovative risk management strategies and tools to achieve productive and allocative efficiencies. A key concept in addressing the new challenges associated with renewables integration and in mobilizing a diverse resource portfolio to mitigate the uncertainty and variability of these intermittent resources is flexibility and risk mitigation . Hence, a central theme of this mini track revolves around identifying metrics and the needs for risk and flexibility. A second theme emphasizes the characterization of market products and public policies that incentivizes optimization and diversification of resources to assure system reliability in face of uncertainty, at least cost. Additionally, we are interested in work focusing on coordination of electricity system with other critical infrastructure systems such as natural gas supply. The first session focuses on market design and analysis while the second focuses on computational aspects of optimizing the planning, operation and procurement of a diverse resource portfolio, and on the management of risk along the energy supply chain as well as the coordination of energy related infrastructures. Session 1: Market Design and Implementation  Session Organizer and Session Chair: Richard D. Tabors (rtabors@tcr-us.com) The electric power industry is undergoing a series of both dramatic and exceedingly rapid changes. The forces at play are being driven by the changing generation portfolio (decarbonization) that is moving generation away from fossil technologies toward increased intermittent, zero marginal cost renewable technologies. Decentralization of both generation and control is being driven by Distributed Energy Resource (DER) availability, creating the prosumer who is able to move away from but not entirely leave the grid. These forces are amplified by the digital revolution that is affecting the entire economy of which the utility industry is but a minor portion but from which the industry is able to benefit. Utilities are being expected to maintain the reliability of delivered energy with fewer firm resources, more intermittent resources and far greater uncertainty in net demand at the interfaces between the wholesale and retail segments of the system. This session aims to bring together leading researchers for comprehensive discussions of the metrics and market structures that will provide the flexibility to adapt to the rapidly changing demands of electric energy systems. The flexibility will inherently cover multiple time scales and can be extracted from the supply side (both traditional and renewable technologies) and from the demand side as DERs, energy storage and responsive demand. Papers that discuss innovative assessment and provision of flexibility from both theoretical and empirical perspectives are encouraged. (Expect 3 to 4 papers in this session) Session 2: Risk Management and Optimization Session Organizer and Session Chairs: Masood Parvania (masood.parvania@utah.edu) and Hao Zhu (haozhu@utexas.edu) Recent progress in optimization theory and software development complimented by dramatic increases in the capability of low cost computer hardware is opening the door for the development of a new generation of methods to assist in the planning and operations of large-scale energy systems such as electric power grids and gas transmission networks. Increased investment and adoption of renewable energy, electric energy storage and systems to facilitate demand response continue to challenge power grid operators in both the operation and planning of a reliable electric infrastructure. The emergence of natural gas as a major fuel for electric generation (and the emergence of the power generation sector as the main area of growth for natural gas transmission services) has brought its own challenges to both electricity and natural gas. Efforts to harmonize market clearing and system operations for electric and gas transmission have been hampered by difficulties in adapting appropriate pricing models for both systems. Meanwhile, high penetration levels of stochastic resources and increasing threats of cyber attacks and natural disasters present great risks to reliable and resilient operation of energy systems. Coordinated planning of electric and gas supply systems needs new tools that integrate systems optimization, market feedbacks, risk management approaches, and the potential for strong system coupling to enhance or hinder reliable operations. On the other hand rapid proliferation of edge technologies facilitates the transition from treatment of risk as a centrally managed public good to privatization of risk and the sharing of supply risk along the energy supply chain. The objective of this session is to bring together papers focused on new problem formulations, algorithmic developments and computational advances that directly address the operational, planning and reliability challenges being faced by operators and users of large-scale energy transmission infrastructures. Papers focusing on new approaches to power flow optimization, stochastic and robust unit commitment, and coordination of power grids and markets with other infrastructures (particularly natural gas transmission) are particularly encouraged. We are also interested in papers on topology control, chance constrained optimization and multi-objective programming. Furthermore, this session welcomes novel research to advance the grid operation model with new understanding of asset and system risk and new risk management approaches (Expect 4 papers in this session) "

The regulatory and market environment in which these resources operate is also changing, with the growth in wind and solar energy necessitating additional requirements for grid support services (such as Order 841 recently passed by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which mandates the development of models for energy storage to participate in regional bulk power markets). Effective integration of distributed resources (behind the meter supply and storage), weather dependent renewables, and mobile electric energy supply and storage through electrified transportation requires evolution in planning, operational and control strategies, as well as an appreciation of how people will adopt and use distributed and mobile resources. This minitrack invites papers that address modeling, simulation and hardware developments; economic and system analyses; and studies of individual and organizational (including governments) behavior and decision making as pertaining to distributed, renewable and mobile resources in electric power systems. Session 1:  Grid-Scale Integration Session Organizer and Chair – Charlie Smith (charlie@esig.energy) Electricity market restructuring, advances in energy generation technology and agreements on the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions have paved the way for a significant increase in the use of renewable generation connected at both the transmission and distribution level. With wind generation currently having the largest share of the new capacity, and solar generation having the highest rate of growth, this trend is expected to continue to produce an increasing amount of variability and uncertainty in system generation portfolios. A broad array of issues associated with the incorporation of large shares of variable generation (VG) into power system planning, design, and operation, including market operation, need to be considered. This session invites technical papers addressing new approaches, models and methods for the planning, design and operation of power systems with large or increasing shares of VG, including the impact of distributed energy resources on the bulk system reliability. We particularly encourage paper that focus on the key issues of managing increased levels of variability and uncertainty on the transmission system with new approaches to increasing co-ordination, system flexibility, the value and role of new grid support services, and incorporating VG plant output forecasting on all time scales, is encouraged. Integration of renewable resources will also require continuing innovation in technology capability to enable the participation of variable generation in AGC systems and ancillary service markets.  New approaches to the evolution of the wind and photovoltaic plant design to enable this participation, including wind/PV/battery hybrids and grid forming converters, are necessary. This session will address some of the challenges and approaches to achieve these goals. (Expect 3 to 4 papers in this session) Session 2: Grid-Edge: Coordination, Communication, and Consumers Session Organizer and Chair: Ward Jewell (ward.jewell@wichita.edu) Distributed energy resources (DERs) include customer-side generation, energy storage (including mobile storage through electrified transportation), flexible loads, and distribution-side sensing devices, and may or may not have coordinated operation as microgrids. DERs can play an important role in providing services to the power system. Flexible loads can be scheduled to balance variable generation; microgrids and strategic storage can provide reliability and security; and distributed sensing can offer unprecedented system visibility. Integration of DERs requires continuing innovation in coordinated control, optimization, modeling, and technology to enable participation in regulation and balancing services, ancillary service markets and distribution system management. Moreover, growth in mobile and stationary DERs vastly increases the number of independent decision-makers providing services to the grid. How these customer-suppliers will interact with DERs and the larger power grid is still evolving rapidly. This session invites technical papers presenting new approaches, models and methods for planning, operating, and architecture of, interconnected transmission and/or distribution systems with significant DER penetration. This session also invites papers that use methods from social science or data analytics to explore the interactions between DER owners at the individual or community scale, the technologies  they control, and the power distribution and transmission system.

Title of a minitrack:   Digitally-enabled Blood Testing in Healthcare    2.  Research track that this minitrack belongs    Information Technology in Healthcare    3.  Description of a minitrack (If your proposal is accepted, this minitrack  description will be posted on the conference website and used as a Call for  Papers for your minitrack.)    Blood testing is one of the most common medical tests to assess various aspects of a  person’s health status, informing approximately 70 percent of medical decisions. There  are more than 100 types of blood tests available [1] and there is an extremely high  demand for laboratory-based blood tests, which gets further overwhelming during the  pandemic [2]. Analysis suggests an important role for digitally-enabled remote blood  monitoring that would enable patients and health professionals to carry out their own  tests remotely, greatly benefiting patients and speeding up decision making [3]. The  future of blood testing will lead to new digital health systems to achieve remote,  inclusive, rapid, affordable and personalized blood monitoring.     This requires the development of interdisciplinary research across several relevant  subject area boundaries such as: clinical science, information and communication  technologies (ICT), data science and artificial intelligence, engineering and social  science. For example ICT for secure data connectivity and data provenance are essential  for remote and multiple parameters blood monitoring. Al and machine learning will  enable automation for faster and accurate blood analysis to replace time and labor- intensive manual analysis, and will enable decentralized clinical trials with shorter  times and lower costs for patient monitoring. Instead of population based blood test  ranges, longitudinal blood monitoring and adaptive analytics will learn from each  patient’s personalized blood value baselines, changes and trends. This will constitute a  personalized approach to inform disease complexity and conditions over time for early  detection and effective treatment management. Furthermore, the story of Theranos [4]  also indicates  the market demand in revolutionizing blood testing but significant  research for real technologies are needed.  Therefore, this mini-track aims to explore  multi-disciplinary approaches for digitally-enabled blood testing for remote monitoring  and personalized analytics.     The minitrack will consider both research in progress and completed working papers in  the related topics.

Chronic diseases and conditions, persist an entire lifetime and generally cannot be prevented by vaccines or cured by medication (Adams, Kirzinger, & Martinez, 2013). This mini-track characterizes Chronic Diseases and Conditions very broadly to include, illnesses (such as diabetes, Alzheimer asthma), conditions (such as physical, sensory, mental, and cognitive disabilities, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autistic spectrum, Tourette syndrome, old age related conditions).  Recurrent illnesses and conditions caused by chronic diseases, if not managed carefully, cannot only diminish quality of life and ability to work, but can also result in health emergencies, complications, and even death (World Health Organization, 2015). According to World Health Organization (WHO), chronic diseases are the leading cause of mortality worldwide, and 80% of chronic disease deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries.  Advancing patients’ ability to engage in self-managed health through information and communication technologies (ICTs), such as mobile technologies and machine learning, is increasingly a top priority (e.g., The National Health Service, 2013, The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, 2014). Effective self-management is a proven way of improving the lives of individuals suffering from chronic diseases (Dadgar and Joshi, 2018). Self-management refers to a care management approach in which patients actively take responsibility for treating their chronic diseases (Bodenheimer et al., 2002). It is a self-regulating, dynamic, continuous, interactive process (Schulman-Green et al., 2012). Despite technological advances in healthcare ICTs that improve care and reduce costs, patients often avoid using them (El-Gayar, Timsina, Nawar, & Eid, 2013). Although, ICTs have improved the health in healthcare services in terms of the delivery of high-quality patient care at low cost, but the development of ICTs that focus chiefly on patient-centered care is still in its infancy (Jacelon, Gibbs, & Ridgway, 2016). With that in mind, we are looking for papers taking a variety of approaches to answering research questions related to the design, development, and use of ICTs on patient-centered care. Such approaches might be described as experiments or quasi-experiments, design science, case studies, surveys, action research, psychometrics, and ethnography. We invite papers that use variety of advanced technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), or Machine Learning (ML). We call for the papers that investigate use of ICTs for patients with chronic physical and psychological conditions, from diabetes and asthma, to obesity and fitness SM programs, to autism, dementia, bipolar disorders, and depression. Studies that investigate technologies that help patients with chronic diseases improve their health and wellness can also be submitted to this minitrack.  Authors are invited to submit papers that address issues related to the design, development, and implementation of ICTs in self-management of chronic diseases and conditions. Potential issues and topics include, but are not limited to:  Learning about condition and health needs  Learning self-management regimen, skills, and strategies ( e.g., Monitoring and managing symptoms, side effects, and body responses, Adjusting treatment regimen to manage symptoms and side effects, Managing/taking medications, Goal setting, decision making, problem solving, planning, prioritizing and pacing in the self-management process) Managing life style changes (e.g. modifying diet, nutrition, smoking, and physical activity, Changing behaviors to minimize disease impact, Balancing living life with health needs, Managing disruptions in school, work, family, and social activities) Managing psychological aspects of chronic diseases and conditions (e.g. Developing confidence and self-efficacy, Reducing stress caused by the chronic disease, Identifying and benefiting from psychological resources drawing on intrinsic resources, e.g., creativity, strength and wisdom from past experiences, Maintaining positive outlook, hope, and self-worth, Dealing with shock of diagnosis, self-blame, and guilt) Managing relationships with healthcare providers (e.g. Creating and maintaining relationships with healthcare providers) Managing and sustaining relationships with family, friends, relatives, and peers (e.g. Creating a community of peers with similar experiences, Obtaining and managing social support from family and friends) Cultivating courage, discipline, and motivation Working through issues of dependence/independence Seeking resources, such as financial assistance (e.g., prescription subsidies), environmental support (e.g., assistive devices), and community resources (e.g., transportation) Exploring and expressing emotional responses Making sense of the chronic disease (e.g. Finding meaning in work, relationships, activities, and spirituality) Identifying and confronting change and loss (e.g., changes in physical function, role, identity, body image, control, and mortality) Developing coping strategies (e.g., self-talk) Focusing on possibilities (e.g., envisioning the future, reframing adversity into opportunity) Designing virtual coaches  ICT designs for elder care and home care  ICT enabled preventative approaches  References Adams, P., Kirzinger, W., & Martinez, M.

Title of a minitrack: Data Platforms and Ecosystems in Healthcare  2.  Track that the minitrack belongs to: Information Technology in Healthcare  3.  Minitrack keywords: data sharing in healthcare, health data platforms and ecosystems, health  data openness, individual privacy preservation in healthcare  4.  Minitrack description:   The past two years of the COVID-19 pandemic have painstakingly highlighted the demand for efficient  healthcare systems in which relevant health data are readily accessible wherever needed, whenever  needed. The amount of sensitive and personal health data collected every day by a variety of mobile  and medical devices (e.g., smartphones, wearables, implants) fosters the emergence of large data  repositories and platforms at scale (Sunyaev et al., 2015). However, it is essential to integrate and  make this data accessible, such as through multisite health data sharing, so that it can be used to  inform and impact care coordination, data-driven care research, and population health (Oborn &  Barrett, 2016; Scheibner et al., 2021). In this context, healthcare systems frequently struggle to realize  nation-wide information infrastructures (cf. Aanestad & Jensen, 2011) and make data accessible to  those healthcare stakeholders who can act upon the knowledge generated from it (Oborn & Barrett,  2016).  Beyond  technological  interoperability  barriers,  there  are  challenges  on  the  individual,  organizational, and societal level (Witte et al., 2020), such as the unwillingness to share health data  openly due to fears of surveillance or misuse by third parties (Thiebes et al., 2017). In this context, it is  critical to design health data sharing in a way that simultaneously preserves individual privacy and data  utility (Scheibner et al., 2021), and to quickly find appropriate policies to do so while leveraging the  benefits of digitization (Anderson & Agarwal, 2011).   This minitrack invites papers on the emergence, design, and evolution of health data ecosystems,  generally defined as multi-stakeholder networks that enable value creation via platforms allowing  various types of health data to be stored, shared, and reused (Oliveira et al., 2019) in a secure, privacy- preserving, and FAIR manner (Wilkinson et al., 2016). We welcome qualitative and quantitative  contributions that shed light on the critical role of data and individual privacy preservation in and  through healthcare platforms and ecosystems. In this context, we specifically encourage submissions  that strongly emphasize practical applicability within the healthcare environment.  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:   -  Data sharing and data donation in healthcare  -  (Open) health data repositories   -  Health data spaces and initiatives for data lofts, communities, and collectives  -  Data-driven value creation in healthcare ecosystems  -  Cases on the emergence, design, and evolution of (open) data platforms in healthcare  -  Design principles for privacy-preserving data platforms in healthcare  -  Use of health data platforms for data-driven care research and artificial intelligence  -  Openness and governance of biomedical data    5.  Journals for fast track opportunities:   We will offer a fast track opportunity for selected papers to Business & Information Systems Engineering  or Electronic Markets.   6.  Marketing plan:  We plan to advertise this minitrack in various international research networks with a focus on  information  technology  in  healthcare.  This,  amongst  others,  includes  the  research  network  of  Copenhagen Business School – Research theme digital health and the German Informatics Society –  Special Interest Group Digital Health.   7.

The  ubiquity of smartphones, smart watches and fitness tracking tools have provided vast amounts  of digital physiologic and behavioral data. These new “phenotypes” of health—prosody of  smartphone use, biometric data surrounding health events, geolocation and ambient  environment conditions—provide an opportunity for social scientists, engineers and clinicians to  advance health interventions antecedent to exacerbations of disease. For example, phenotypes  of smartphone use have been correlated with changes in mental health and pain, ingestible  sensors measure real-time changes and contexts of medication adherence in various diseases,  and biometric data may predict different states of health conditions prior to their clinically  apparent manifestation. The COVID-19 pandemic has additionally advanced these systems and  now we are presented with an opportunity where digital biomarkers and personal technologies  are increasingly accepted as health management tools. Additionally, on a population health  level, technologies that leverage public health infrastructure such as wastewater-based  epidemiology and crowdsourced street maps are providing never before seen insights into the  effects of disease in communities.     This minitrack provides an opportunity for multidisciplinary collaboration and exploration of the  various facets of health technologies and their ability to surveil and predict disease. We  encourage submissions that describe:  •  Innovative technological solutions and applications in chronic disease management  •  Pilot work around the real-world deployment and application of health technologies at a  personal and population health level  •  Qualitative research that informs behavioral health theory and acceptance models  around personal health technology  •  Health law and ethical approaches to personal and population health disease  surveillance  •  Early development and boundary condition exploration of technologies to detect  changes in disease or health status    Marketing Plan: This is our sixth year proposing this minitrack in the Health Information  Technology track. Over the past six years, we have brought together authors with primary  expertise as social scientists, practicing clinicians, data scientists and patient advocates. Our  past two years of the minitrack were unfortunately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic:  although we experienced decreased submissions, this last year we accepted four innovative  papers describing novel health technologies surrounding the patient experience, substance use  disorders, and machine learning algorithms on simulated datasets to improve health care  utilization. We anticipate that we will once again broadly disseminate our minitrack and leverage  contacts we have developed over the past six years at HICSS as well as our funded  collaborators at NIH, NSF and DARPA. We have uniquely used our minitrack time to not only  present accepted papers, but also foster discussions as a group of authors and audience  members to define what lessons have been learned in health technology research in the past  year with the intention of defining the next iteration of the minitrack. This year’s proposal is the  culmination of our experiences as researchers and clinicians working with emerging  technologies over the years. We will refine our marketing plan to include individual invitations to  submit via email with researchers in our network with projects pertaining to topics within our  minitrack, including investigators in computer science, electrical engineering, mHealth, and  wearable sensor focused translational medicine. We additionally will encourage alumni of the  minitrack from HICSS 51-55 to submit papers. We will also advertise our minitrack at health IT  conferences (Partners Connected Health, mHealth summit, HIMSS, IEEE wearables standards  workgroups and American Medical Informatics Association). We anticipate potential fast track  opportunities with the Journal of Medical Internet Research, Journal of Medical Systems,  Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association and/or Frontiers in Digital Health.

Whether to promote health management and prevent disease, or to make decisions around seeking or managing care, persuasive systems can promote behavior change on a personal or societal level.   This minitrack focuses on how persuasive systems and services created to influence health behaviors are designed, developed, implemented and evaluated. These Health Behavior Change Support Systems (HBCSS) can assist behavior change through a variety of techniques and tools, such as providing information, education or motivation through an intentional system. The minitrack highlights how persuasive theories and models can be used to develop and evaluate efficient and effective HBCSSs for different contexts, including healthcare.   As all HBCSSs are persuasive systems, designed with the intent to influence user behavior, recognition of their applicability to patient health management is growing. Designing HBCSS interventions with, and building technology platforms for, the patients as end-users is a major area of research to combat health challenges and achieve the outcomes desired. Some example topics are persuasive systems created for self-care, games designed to support chronic care, how end-users can be involved to design a system, and evaluation methods to assess the impact of a system on health behaviors. Our minitrack presents a wide range of cutting-edge research addressing the challenges to technology use for health behavior change. Emphasis in the minitrack will be placed on both design and development of the HBCSSs, implementation and evaluation, or appraisal, of their effects or artifacts. The primary focus is not purely about methodologies or technologies, but also their impact on a population or problem. Work to further develop design protocols and rigorous, long-term research of impact for BCSS is encouraged.  The topics of interest include, but are not limited to: Design and development Create HBCSS interventions using stakeholders’ perspectives (users and experts)  Design of mobile technologies for health (mHealth) and mobile approaches to HBCSSs HBCSS development that incorporates users early on in order to tailor systems with user profiles, characteristics or preferences Persuasive strategies to support activities offline (e.g. to support viewing and downloading virtual exercises, social support in lifestyle changing programs) Persuasive prompts to create engagement and involvement in serious game interventions Creation and testing of user profiles to identify which persuasive strategies matter most for whom Discussion or evaluation of design approaches for developing HBCSSs, including considerations for personalization, privacy and security Implementation and evaluation Health behaviour change through mobile technologies, teleconsultation and telemedicine Patient education, patient empowerment, decision support tools for patients, and remote monitoring Evaluation of persuasiveness of different HBCSSs (mobile, ubiquitous, ambient technologies), moving towards a checklist for practice Adequate design for measuring the effect of persuasive strategies on task adherence during usage and long-term effects Frameworks and methodologies to measure A/B/C-Changes (attitude change, behavior change, or an act of compliance) Profiling personalities and matching them with persuasive strategies Multimodal cues and measurement of the effects on adherence and outcomes Advanced analytics to predict adherence, and to identify usage patterns and the effects on adherence  Marketing Plan  We have circulated the call for paper proposals to this minitrack before to our respective academic and research networks, universities and relevant professional organizations. For example, we have sent out the call to the Society of Behavioral Medicine’s special Interest group “Behavioral Information Technology”. We will utilize the call for papers for this minitrack using the same strategy, including at the annual Persuasive Technology conference. Additionally, the minitrack chairs have collected information from previous HICSS 2020, 2021 and 2022 minitrack attendees on their contact information and areas of interest. We will send out the call for paper proposals to this group in addition to our previously-utilized strategies.   Journals for Fast-track Opportunity N/A  Minitrack Co-Chairs  Amanda C.

The design of services is often different from  traditional service design—as for many healthcare services patients receive care, but  insurance companies pay for it. Implementing processes in this domain should result in  providing faster, safer and more effective care, necessitating organizing and sharing  information among all participants involved in patient care. While the need for well- defined healthcare processes is clear, there are many obstacles and opportunities for  research, including technical, behavioral, and organizational topics.   Operational Research approaches including mathematical programming and simulation  modelling can help address and solve logistical challenges in designing and managing  healthcare  processes  and  services.  While  mathematical  programming  can  give  the  optimal  locations  of  ambulances or  shift  schedules  for  hospital  doctors,  simulation  approaches are a crucial tool to analyze different scenarios and model complex settings  like emergency departments or operating rooms.  Decision support systems play a crucial role in healthcare, not only in the form of clinical  decision support systems to assist physicians and other health professionals with medical  decision making, but also to support logistical and organizational processes.  This minitrack will focus on the analysis, design and optimization of healthcare systems,  the use of IT to support and improve care processes as well as non-IT assets such as  process changes, innovative IT artefacts, and interoperability standards.     We invite papers that focus on, but are not limited to:      Analysis and optimization of healthcare processes and services (e.g. patient  pathways, appointment planning, hospital logistics, emergency medical services)    Multi-criteria decision analysis of healthcare processes and services    Machine learning and artificial intelligence for healthcare processes and services  (e.g. demand forecasts, medical decision making)    Design of decision support systems in healthcare    Design and analysis of healthcare processes and services    Simulation studies of healthcare processes and services (e.g. emergency  departments, hospital logistics)    Simulation-optimization approaches for healthcare processes and services    The use of medical devices to support the processes and services    Organizational change management for implementing new processes    Impact of IT-enabled coordination of processes on patient/population health  outcomes (e.g. hospital readmissions, cost efficiency)      MINITRACK CO-CHAIRS:    Melanie Reuter-Oppermann, Technical University of Darmstadt, oppermann@is.tu- darmstadt   Cameron Walker, University of Auckland, cameron.walker@auckland.ac.nz  Nikolaus Furian, University of Graz, nikolaus.furian@tugraz.at       MARKETING PLAN:    Our marketing plan to solicit papers for our minitrack mainly consists of two parts:  personal advertisement and mailing lists/newsletters. We will send personal emails to  our collaborators, colleagues and reviewers from the last years to invite them to submit  to our minitrack. In addition, we will send the CfP to the mailing lists of ORAHS (the  European working group on Operations Research applied to Health Care), the mailing  list of the AIS (Association of Information Systems), the mailing list of VHB/WKWI (the  German economics and IS interest group) and the special interest group health within  the AIS. Moreover, we will send the CFP to the authors of the GOR (German OR society),  EURO (European OR society), ORSNZ (New Zealand OR Society), Informs and the  International Society on MCDM (Multiple Criteria Decision Making) newsletters.  The proposed CfP is based on the minitrack “Optimization, Simulation and IT for  Healthcare Processes and Services” that we chaired at this year’s HICSS and with a  slightly different title the two years before. We realized that the title could be even  more inviting to the community, and we also adapted the focus points based on the  feedback we received, during the overall process but also the online session. We also  shaped the focus of the minitrack a bit more. For the last 4 HICSS conferences we  received 10, 15, 7 and 22 submissions and chose 4, 6, 4 and 9 papers for presentations.  The slight shift of the focus for HICSS 55 made the minitrack attractive to many authors  who also expressed their interest to submit again this year. Therefore, we expect a good  number of high quality publications again.  We also aim for a fast-track opportunity at a journal that focuses on optimization for  healthcare. This will be addressed once the minitrack proposal is accepted.

As an outcome,  we are surrounded by ubiquitous data about our environment and ourselves. The data have  never been as easily accessible as they are today, thinking about today’s infrastructure and  technology. With instant access to sensitive and personal data, users can autonomously make  decisions and change their behavior. According to Vailshery (May 28, 2021), in “2020, there  were 31 million active users of Fitbit products who used their device at least once a week.”1    Technology companies like Fitbit and Apple offer users the possibility to self-track and self- quantify their health and fitness-related behavior. “Meet the app that puts a world of health &  fitness in your hands”2 or “It’s the fitness partner that fits on your wrist.”3   The data collected and visualized to a user range from steps to heart rate and sleep duration.  According to Lupton (2016, p. 2), self-tracking is an activity that is “directed at regularly  monitoring and recording, and often measuring, elements of an individual’s behavior or bodily  functions.” Self-tracking technologies are more of a facilitator than the leading actor in this  regard. Indeed, the users are still characterized as the leading actors.  Self-tracking is not only applicable for  monitoring physical activity, exercising, and sleep  monitoring; it can be used for tracking chronic disease, mental health and wellness, and  fertility.    This minitrack aims to enable a critical discussion reflecting on opportunities and challenges  regarding self-tracking technologies within the health-related area. Thereby, this minitrack  concentrates  on  its  users  and  the  opportunities  and  challenges  of  applying  self-tracking  technologies.    Studies  already  confirm  that  activity  tracking  technologies  (here  fitness  trackers,  smart  watches, mobile applications) can support users to be physically more active, especially for  short-term use (Feng, Li, & Agosto, 2017; Ilhan & Henkel, 2018). There were also investigations  regarding integrating self-tracking technologies within the working environment (Emerson,  Heavin, & Power, 2020) and the possibility to monitor and support patients apart from the  hospital regarding recovery and being physically more active (Paredes et al., 2021). The  implementation scenarios of self-tracking technologies are diverse and not yet exhausted,  especially within the healthcare, working and educational environment. Further, as Shin et al.  (2019) already pointed out, the relation between the user and the provided data, information,  and knowledge, i.e., human-information interaction, is less investigated yet.       1 Retrieved February 12, 2022: https://www.statista.com/statistics/472600/fitbit-active-users/  2 Retrieved February 12, 2022: https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/home  3 Retrieved February 12, 2022: https://www.apple.com/watch/why-apple-watch/    - 1 -  Nevertheless, monitoring, increasing awareness, and reflecting on the visualized data 24 hours  7 days a week could sometimes blur unintended consequences. The minitrack also offers a  platform to discuss several potential challenges that could include the design and visualization  of the collected data and the required digital and health information literacy skills. Self-tracking  technologies enable the first step to get access to health-related data without the advice of a  healthcare professional. However, the interpretation and reflection of the data remain to the  users. Further aspects that need to be thematized are emotional well-being, especially when  users are not reaching their goals. Finally, this mintrack will also seek submissions that shed  light on why and in which context users apply self-tracking technologies as those aspects can  lead to unintended consequences. According to Eikey & Reddy (2017, p. 642-643), “the role of  technology can shift depending on where users are in their health ‘journey’.” For example, they  interviewed women with an eating disorder who use weight loss apps. Their call is not to see  technology as positive or negative and therefore, to avoid a “binary view of technology”.    All submissions that bring different disciplines together are welcomed, especially computer  science,  system  sciences,  social  sciences,  psychology,  medicine,  health  informatics,  and  information science. The interplay of different aspects (technology, user, context) are crucial  for the success of self-tracking technologies. Information systems need to be designed so that  provided information is useful, understandable, and individually fitted. The latter shows a  challenge that several information systems are facing―to provide individual useful information  in the long-term. Apart from understandable visualization and explanations, the user's context  and cultural and mental background play a crucial role.     Potential (empirical, conceptual, quantitative, and qualitative) submissions for this minitrack  should address the challenges and/or opportunities regarding the following aspects:  •  use and integration studies of health-related self-tracking technologies in:  o   everyday life, working environment (employment), healthcare, and education  o  in  different  health-related  contexts  (e.g.,  physical  activity,  chronic  illness,  fertility, mental health and wellness)  •  considering different stakeholders (e.g., health insurances, libraries, hospitals, doctors)  and  their  role  and  impact  on  users’  self-tracking  technologies  acceptance  and  usefulness  •  discontinuance and short-term usage studies with aiming to shed light on implications  of developing self-tracking technologies for long-term usage  •  to what extent gamification elements and the design of goal setting:  o   motivate and support activity tracking technologies (e.g., from a psychological  perspective)  o  cause negative feelings (e.g., feeling guilty, disappointed) and burden a user  •  impact  of  presented  information  and  visualizations,  both  emotional  aspects  and  cognitive load (e.g., health information literacy, information avoidance)    Important:  Here, self-tracking technologies are defined as:  •  Health-related mobile applications:  o  Physical  activity,  workouts,  sleep  monitoring:  e.g.,  Fitbit,  Strava,  Runtastic,  Samsung Health   o  Weight loss: e.g., WeightWatchers    - 2 -  o  Mental health: mood tracker (e.g., Daylio Journal), healthier thoughts habits  (e.g., What’s Up)  •  Fitness trackers (wristbands) for physical activity, workouts, sleep monitoring: e.g.,  Fitbit, Xiaomi, Garmin  •  Smart watches: e.g., Apple Watch, Samsung Watch              Minitrack Chair:    Dr. Aylin Imeri (Ilhan)  Research Associate at the Department of Information Science  Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf  Germany  Aylin.ilhan@hhu.de | Aylin.Imeri@hhu.de    Aylin Imeri (Ilhan) is a research associate and post-doc at the Information Science Dept. at the  Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Germany.

Accomplishing these goals necessitates the need to create a dialog between science, operations and business.   This mini-track welcomes papers on leveraging health IT and data science, including AI, to advance healthcare delivery, patient engagement, patient outcomes and improve clinical decision making outside of the hospital (i.e., home healthcare, hospice, outpatient clinics, patient home, skilled nursing or rehabilitation facilities, nursing homes). The mini-track is open to multiple research methods including qualitative, quantitative and design science approaches.  Topics of interest in the non-hospital setting include, but are not limited to: Utilization of novel data science approaches (i.e., AI and machine learning) on clinical and personal health data Machine learning and natural language processing approaches for enhanced decision making  Utilizing digital health tools (i.e. mHealth and wearables) to improve consumer/patient engagement Improving patient and provider communication through digital health tools  Leveraging disparate data streams (i.e. operational, clinical and business) to improve healthcare delivery Detecting and eliminating algorithmic biases in health AI (e.g., racial biases) Using AI to improve care for minority populations  Evaluation of health IT/AI Translational science of AI and human factors Telehealth Metadata and Data Standards  Keywords: Data Science, AI, Health IT, Machine learning, mHealth, non-hospital   Research Track that this mini-track belongs to is: Information Technology in Healthcare     Marketing Plan The chair and two co-chairs will send the call for mini-track submission to their respective professional and academic colleagues via email and messages boards.

Developed economies already begin facing the issues arising from fewer young people having to take care of more and more seniors and less developed countries are expected to be hit even harder in the foreseeable future (World Health Organization, 2015).  The continuous evolution of technology has led to a multi-faceted digitization of health care providing new possibilities for health and well-being for aging individuals and society at large. Innovation in patient-centered technological solutions, such as smartphone apps, health gadgets (smart watches etc.) and specific social media platforms indicate the increasing shift to self- initiated and self-coordinated health measures. These offerings aim to support the preservation of people’s physical, psychological, and social well-being, i.e. they enable longer autonomous living. Although contemporary technologies aim to assist people in health-related aspects they often do not meet the specific needs and requirements of seniors. Hence, it becomes important to understand how and why elderly people interact with technology and how adequate tools and systems must be designed for this growing segment. We invite papers that address the grand challenges ahead by providing insights (IS Research) and suggesting innovative solutions (Design Science Research).  How can digital innovations be used to provide health related services for the aging generation? The minitrack is open to a broad variety of research, conceptual or empirical. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to): Age-related digital divide in the IS discipline Age-related roles and stereotypes with respect to technology Specific IT/IS-adoption patterns of the elderly Online and mobile health platforms and communities for seniors The impact of e- and m-health, virtual communities, and social media on the well-being of seniors Theories and research frameworks for investigating age-related IS phenomena  Methodological challenges of investigating elderly people’s technology usage Impact of technology training on technology adoption and usage Effective design of technology for elderly people Factors influencing technology/e-health/m-health adoption and usage of seniors Technology design factors influencing technology adoption and diffusion by seniors Computer and Internet self-efficacy of seniors Technostress of elderly people Success factors, barriers and risks of technology adoption by seniors Understanding of elderly people’s technology needs and requirements User interface design, usability and accessibility issues Integration of elderly people in the design of technology Visions for future technologies for seniors Meta-analyses and meta-syntheses of research on elderly people in various IS phenomena Novel and innovative research on technology for seniors Trust and distrust of elderly people in e- and m-health Changes in personality characteristics and its impact on adoption of technology  Minitrack Co-Chairs:   Heiko Gewald (Primary Contact) Neu-Ulm University of Applied Sciences, Germany Email:   Karoly Bozan  Duquesne University, USA Email:   Doug Vogel Harbin Institute of Technology, China Email: vogel.doug@gmail.com   We ran this minitrack successfully over the last HIICSS conferences and would like to continue to do so.

The use of wearable technology to track daily activity, heart rate, and sleep to give insights and provide an understanding of individual health and sleep patterns has become an increasingly prominent habit of everyday life. People are to a larger extent wearing sensors, e.g. watches, rings, etc., that continuously collect data i.e. movement, heart rate, and sleep. In addition to that, sensors that can be placed near the body, are on the rise. Such sensors can e.g. be placed under the mattress to track sleep, or in houses to track movement. These sensors are meant to track movement and vital signs, although not body-worn. The data is processed by the company that produced the sensors, and summary statistics are visualized in their custom-made mobile applications. However, the data from those sensors is yet seldom used for healthcare purposes, or by healthcare professionals even though it carries valuable information on health in general and about physique, condition, and sleep quality in particular. Just like diet and exercise, sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining good physical and mental health, but the impact of sleep (or lack of sleep) on daily activity and heart rate and the relationship between these vital signs is something that lightweight sensor technology can help us to understand. The goal of this mini-track is to shed light on sensor data as a data-gathering technique for healthcare purposes in general and the potential of (and lack of potential) sensor data as a driver for understanding health in general and sleep in particular. In addition to that, the mini-track is also interested in an open discussion on how sensor technology can be used to enrichen sleep research, and how data-gathering over an extended period of time, through self-trackers can enhance research, especially in relation to well-being and health, both physical and mental.  The mini-track is interested in papers that take on analyzing sleep and sleeping behaviors collected with sensors and their relation to health and general well-being through data-driven approaches. The interest extends to papers that shed light on the type of data that is required to improve sleep analysis and how that data can be used to facilitate and improve the knowledge of the general public of their own sleeping patterns and behavior. The interest goes beyond sleep alone, as we welcome research devoted to the correlation between vital signs and health, both physical and mental, on a cohort level as well as for individual self-care purposes. The interest thereby extends to papers discussing different approaches in data analytics while also welcoming papers discussing qualitative research on designing, developing, and using digital platforms that take in third-party data from various sensors and bring sensor data into healthcare. The interest is therefore not merely in big data but also extends to the use of small data, that can support sleep patterns or health tracking for individuals or for healthcare professionals through various types of sensors that collect health data continuously over some period of time. The papers can take the point of departure from the healthcare side, or an individual perspective, or even be written from the intersection between the healthcare and the individuals’ practices. We are also interested in specific sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea and insomnia. In addition to that, the papers can take on challenges and benefits for sleep analysis in general and on the dark sides of relying on sensor data from body-worn sensors.  Based on that we encourage papers based on both qualitative and quantitative methods, and on machine learning approaches, as well as empirical, methodological, and theoretical papers that inspire a dialog with the growing literature on sleep analysis, health tracking through sensor data, and datafication of healthcare settings. In addition to that, we welcome papers reporting on the intersection between data from new types of sensors, with already validated sleep technologies.

"HICSS-56","HC","Information Technology in Healthcare","9f0223e4-7fb8-4040-bcb7-f1abedc5b6a0","Socia Media and Healthcare Technology","Social media is changing the way patients, medical practitioners, and healthcare organizations, interact. Patients use social media to create communities with similar medical concerns or diagnoses, to research health related issues, and to inform their health decisions —including selecting a doctor, researching courses of treatment and sharing experiences with online communities. Clinicians and researchers use social media to design and implement behavioral interventions for a variety of health conditions, and to study how social media shapes healthcare decisions. Physicians use it to network professionally with colleagues and share medical knowledge within the medical community.  Healthcare providers and organizations use social media to serve their communities, patients, and physicians, while also building awareness and enhancing their brand. Each of these uses provide opportunities to consider how social media influences health care, and to consider what data derived from social media exchanges – and which analytical methodologies – best serves this goal. This minitrack provides a venue for researchers to present current work and discuss diverse uses relating to social media in healthcare including methodological, conceptual, and design issues.  Papers will include research studies that: Describe social media communities and the mining of data from social media platforms to address health issues; Evaluate the design, development, and implementation of social media applications related to health; Assess the impact of these applications, including impacts on patients, healthcare providers, organizations, and society in general; and Develop theories and models to better understand the mechanisms by which social media produces impacts on healthcare and health behavior. Research in this rapidly developing field must address key methodological questions, we therefore welcome submission that critically engage the following: How are health-related social media data appropriately accessed? What constitutes an appropriate social media data set? What analytic strategies or theories, both quantitative and qualitative, are optimal for analyzing social media data? How to best measure effectiveness, acceptability and reach of social media-delivered health education? What human subjects or ethical guidelines, inform the use of data obtained through social media? Are existing social media applications designed to produce medical, psychological or public health impacts effective, safe and acceptable? "

Many companies expect to gain a competitive  advantage from AI and eagerly investigate the promising fields of application [2]. In this endeavor, the  solutions for AI-enabled processes, products, and business models have continuously become more  sophisticated [3].   AI-based assistants are an important and particularly innovative field in this development. They  leverage AI in two ways. First, virtual personal assistants and chatbots such as Amazon Alexa and the  Google Home [4] redefine the interaction of human beings with applications by replacing the standard  user interface via mouse, keyboard, and screen with voice. Second, AI-based Assistants based on  decision rules (e.g., Robotic Process Automation, RPA) or on cognitive intelligence have the potential  to support or replace human beings when interacting with information systems.  On the technological side, the key technologies of AI-based assistants are already in use for numerous  areas  of  the  digital  economy.  They  employ  technologies  such  as  natural  language  processing,  predictive analytics, machine learning, as well as voice recognition and generation. In this way, AI- based assistants evolve into a new general-purpose technology [5]. On the application side, AI-based  assistants unlock business value through automating processes, intensifying the interaction with the  customer, reducing errors, speeding up interactions. Following the understanding that information  systems  are  socio-technical  in  nature,  AI-based  assistants  should  be  framed  as  a  step  toward  humanizing technology and working environments.   Goal of the Artificial Intelligence-based Assistants Minitrack  Based on the successful events 2021 and 2022 with 14 and 12 submissions [6], the minitrack “Artificial  Intelligence-based Assistants” shall promote the scientific exchange on AI-based assistants for the  digital economy. It has been the only minitrack at HICSS that explicitly addresses the topic of AI-based  assistants. The minitrack shall enable researchers to present and discuss innovative approaches,  methodologies, models, processes, etc., to design, implement, deploy, operate and optimize AI-basved  assistants for the Digital Economy. The minitrack shall address also broader aspects such as platform  and ecosystems of AI-based platforms.  Focus of the Artificial Intelligence-based Assistants Minitrack  The AI-based assistants minitrack deals with the following topics, but contributions can also be  submitted on other topics.    Applications and use cases of AI-based assistants     Business models and processes based on AI-based assistants    Platforms and ecosystems of AI-based assistants    Integration of AI-based assistants with services and platforms    Hardware and software technologies for AI-based assistants    Methods, models, and architectures to design and manage AI-based assistants    Innovation processes for assistant platforms    Benefits, risks, security and trust of assistants          Social contexts and business implications     Transparency and explainability of the behavior of AI-based assistants    Collaboration of humans and AI-based assistants    Human interaction with robots to enhance learning and cognition    Digital twins and user models  Marketing plan  Based on the experiences of the last conferences, the activities for directly addressing potential  authors will be intensified, and the broad effect of further measures will be increased.   Direct contact with active authors  The  starting  point  is  an  intensive  search  for  authors  who  have  recently  published  at  related  conferences on minitrack topics. These authors will be contacted via e-mail and invited to submit their  work. Over 200 people were addressed for the 2021 and 2022 events.  Leveraging the community  To improve the personal approach of potential authors, the chairs of the minitrack will specifically  activate multipliers in their communities. These will be used to address potential authors in a targeted  manner. The chairs of this minitrack proposal are in different program committees, boards, etc., which  promises a broad dissemination of the minitrack call.  Website  In order to attract potential authors, a website will be set up that offers potential authors in-depth  information and explanations on the topic of AI-based assistants. Among other things, a bibliography  with publications on AI-based assistants will be offered.

Over the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning  (ML) techniques coupled with the advent of big data have achieved breakthrough performances  in a wide range of activities including online user modeling, software writing, disease diagnosis,  fraud detection, autonomous driving, speech and facial recognition, spam and malware  filtering, and chatbots.   Companies across various industries are eager to find ways and leverage such technologies to  transform core business processes, create business value, and achieve strategic advantages. As  more and more AI and ML tools and algorithms are being available and easily accessible, how  they are used/misused have profound implications to the business and society. A successful  implementation of AI requires not only technical awareness but also business awareness and  ethical considerations. The performance of AI and ML relies critically on the data and the  context it observes and learns. It is important that the transparency and fairness of algorithmic  models and decisions ae preserved. Additionally, as such algorithms are being deployed across  various economic activities, it is equally important to understand their societal impacts. What  happens to jobs, skills, wages, and labor market when algorithmic systems are adopted by  businesses to perform a given task traditionally done by humans? What are the implications to  process design and business models when ML and AI algorithms help make personalized  1    recommendations? What challenges and risks do AI systems bring to decision making, society,  and humankind? We believe these questions merit serious and rigorous studies in the coming  decades.  This minitrack invites submissions of original work concerning business value, implications, and  impacts associated with the development and applications of AI and ML technologies and  algorithms. While work using ML algorithms are highly encouraged, they must have an  important component investigating the impacts and implications of such algorithms. We also  welcome submissions of research-in-progress as well as those that are practically oriented yet  have the potential to make significant contributions to the broad business community.   The relevant topics for the minitrack include, but are not limited to, the following areas:  •  User behavior/response/reaction to algorithm fairness, bias, aversion  •  Economic and societal impacts/implications of AI and ML algorithms  •  Digital platform/market design and algorithms  •  Algorithms economy such as buying, selling algorithms  •  Human-algorithm interaction   •  Algorithm management and organization strategy  •  Explainability, interpretability, and accountability of AI and ML  •  Knowledge discovery from unstructured data  •  Theory-guided AI and ML algorithm development and evaluation  •  AL and ML applications in fintech, operations, cybersecurity, healthcare, accounting   Marketing Plan  The co-chairs will market the minitrack to some of the largest professional associations  including Association for Information Systems, HICSS community, INFORMS, Production and  Operations Management Society, Academy of Management, American Economic Association,  American Marketing Association, and IEEE. We also plan to promote the minitrack to data  science and industry leaders that are at the forefront of developing and/or applying AI  technologies for business use cases in various industries including finance, healthcare,  operations and IT, social media. Additionally, the co-chairs will leverage the opportunity of  attending relevant workshops/conferences to contact professional colleagues for suggestions  of potential authors/speakers. The co-chairs also plan to work with the EICs of ECRA and/or  POMS for fast track publication opportunities.

Domains include work related to detecting, mitigating, and preventing both internal and external human threats to organizational security. Papers may include theory development, empirical studies (both quantitative and qualitative), case studies, and other high-quality research manuscripts.  Topics include, but are not limited to: Creative investigations of actual user security behavior, both positive and negative Exploration of non-rational antecedents of security and privacy behaviors Detecting and mitigating insider threats Security policy compliance research – motivations, antecedents, levers of influence Analysis of known and unknown modes and vectors of internal and external attack SETA (security education, training, and awareness) programs Modeling of security and privacy behavioral phenomena and relationships Merging methodological topics related to addressing research strategies in IS security Translational science perspectives and strategies for IS security research Theory development, theory building, and theory testing in information security Neurosecurity (NeuroIS) investigations of information security behavior Qualitative investigations of security and privacy behaviors. Explorations of emerging issues related to the security of the “Internet of Things” (IoT)  This mintrack will provide IS/IT researchers a collaborative forum to share their research approaches. We hope to attract the skills and insights of scholars from a wide set of disciplines, presenting a mix of theoretical and applied papers on threats and mitigation. Areas of research may include the following.  1. Research related to insider threats to information security and privacy represent the first and most important thread for the minitrack. Insider threats include activities ranging from non-malicious and non-volitional behaviors (accidents and oversights) to volitional, but not malicious, actions to malicious actions such as theft, fraud, blackmail, sabotage, and embezzlement.  2. External vectors of attack by individuals and organizations outside the security perimeter represent the second thread for this minitrack. Specific topics of interest include hacker behaviors, cyber-warfare, identity theft (and electronic deception), and cyber-espionage, including most offensive and defensive methods of prevention, detection, and remediation. Other external parties are motivated to use IT to damage or steal trade secrets, national security information, sensitive account information, or other valuable assets.  3. A third thread revolves around security policy compliance, both at the individual and organizational level of analysis. Compliance is not merely a binary concept – it is a continuum. Individuals may minimally comply with formal security and privacy policies and procedures, or they may exhibit extra-role or stewardship behaviors that go above and beyond official compliance. Similarly, individuals may carelessly violate organizational security policies and procedures without malicious intent or they may attempt to cause maximum damage or loss.  4. Modeling and theory building in the context of IS security and privacy represents yet another interesting area. Theoretical development in information systems security and privacy research is immature relative to other areas of study in the information systems discipline. This sub-discipline of information systems continues to suffer from a limited theoretical base, restricting our collective ability to properly interpret reality, to apply appropriate methodological approaches, and to substantiate conclusions. Adaptation of theories from applied social psychology and criminology are particularly fertile areas for expanding our knowledge base in this domain. Theories from the disciplines of management, education, and others may also inform our understanding of the phenomena of interest.  5. Finally, we have a particular interest in emerging, rigorous research methods for investigating these phenomena. Organizational-level research can be improved, but studies conducted at the individual level, in particular, can benefit from new experimental designs and new data collection methods. Examples include neurophysiological (NeuroIS) methods such as EEG or fMRI, the factorial survey method, and simulations.  Important: each coauthor of a paper submitted to our mini-track is obligated to review at least one other paper for the mini-track. Failure of any one coauthor to review for the mini-track may result in the rejection of the coauthor's paper from the mini-track.  Marketing Plan for our Mini-Track  As in past years, my co-chairs and I will publicize our mini-track among the research community that focuses on behavioral research in Information Systems Security and Privacy.  We will not only post the CFP to AISWorld, but we will also distribute the CFP to four security-focused listservs (or email distributions), including CCREP, SOUP, AIS SIG-SEC, and IFIP WG 8.11/11.13.  We anticipate repeating our prior success in attracting sufficient high-quality papers to form three solid sessions of three papers each.  Statement of Support  My organization endorses my involvement and will pay for my travel and registration cost to attend HICSS.

Description and keywords of a minitrack Keywords: enterprise blockchain, DLT, digital platforms, business models, governance Among other promising technologies, Distributed LedgerTechnologies(DLTs),often referred to as Blockchain, promise to be one of the most disruptive technologies since the invention of the internet’s TCP/IP protocol.ThecombinationofDLTcharacteristics such as accountability, pseudonymity, or distributed network topology, as well as the first cryptocurrency Bitcoin, drew enormous attention given the ubiquitous amount of possibilities for whichthistechnologycanbeusedsinceitsinventionin2008bySatoshi Nakamoto. Whereas TCP/IP lowered the cost of transferring data between two parties dramatically, DLTs have the potential to reduce the costoftransactions(i.e.,transferof assets and value) dramatically. DLTs can enable the secure transfer of any asset worldwide with nearly instant accountability by specifically cutting out intermediary trustholdersduetothecapabilitiesofthenetwork’sproof-of-Xtrust-buildingprocesses, e.g., the Bitcoin proof-of-work mining concept. More recent developments built on top of DLTs, like smart contracts and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), take the possibilities of programmable secure transactions even further. However, during the peak of inflated expectations, most DLT applications remainedon a conceptual level. Now, reaching the trough of disillusionment in the Gartner Hype Cycle, DLT applications need to be put to the test to show the promised effects. Hence, this minitrack welcomes research regarding methodsandtechniques,issuesandcritical challenges, as well as organizational approaches for understanding the potential of DLTs for business models, value chains, organizations, governance mechanisms, emerging competitive landscapes, and new start-ups. Besides, submissions should address specific industry or organizational applications and focus on the technology layer, strategic organizational challenges, social implications about core values, andthe socio-technical perspective on governing organizations that use DLT. By opening this track to the IT, economic/management science, and IS community, we foster the interdisciplinarity needed to grasp the phenomenon from differentperspectives.Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: ● Applications of DLT and their potential in different areas (e.g., insurance, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, energy sector, manufacturing, transportation, automotive industry, provenance, education, government sector) ● The Business implications of Blockchains and Internet of Things (e.g., machine-to-machine interaction, automated devices, DLT for metered appliances) ● The impact on business models (e.g., change of existing business models, the emergence of new business models, disruptive business models) ● Organizational transformation through DLT (e.g., distributed autonomous organizations) 1http://hicss.hawaii.edu/tracks-50/internet-and-the-digital-economy/ ● Implications and challenges on governing and co-creating value inorganizations that use DLT ● Smart contracts and process automation in and between organizations, technology adoption and diffusion ● The impact on the value chain (e.g., disintermediation, change of actors, advantages and disadvantages), the internet and the digital economy ● Regulatory aspects of Blockchains and implications for risk management ● Philosophical issues on the use of Blockchains (e.g., governance of blockchain society, decentralization of society, change in corevalues,buildingofcommunity and collaboration) ● IT Management issues of Blockchains ● Blockchain Platforms and Ecosystems ● Blockchain Based Data Markets ● Blockchain Consortia ● Use of decentralized digital identities in business applications ● Token economy, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) We are open to all methodological approaches such as case studies, surveys, experiments, conceptual papers, and Design/Engineering research. 3. Marketing Plan The Technical University of Munich will cover the primary marketing for the minitrack and utilize the University’s corporate communication center. With full access to both classic and social media streams as well as a worldwide network, that the chairpersons embody, there is no doubt that this track will catch the attention of a broad scientific audience as well as media coverage. With ties to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) the chair will inform colleagues at MIT, BU, and Harvard through various DLT and Blockchain mailing lists as well as faculty at MIT Sloan School of Business. Further, TUMiscurrentlyfoundingabroadernetworkofDLTandBlockchain researchers including Prof. Dr. Philipp Sandner, Prof. Dr. Florian Mattes and Dr. Andranik Tumasjan which are all performing the groundwork on DLT and Blockchain technology for the scientific community. Given the prominence of blockchain technologies in the scientific discourse and the attendance of the minitrack sessions at the HICSS-52, 53, 54 and 55, we expect this minitrack to receive a sufficientnumberofpapers.Nonetheless,wewillalsousetheAIS forums and the emergent network of Blockchain researchers as well as the Blockchain communities to distribute the call.

Crow-based platforms include online labor markets  (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk, Freelancer.com), crowdsourcing platforms (e.g.,  Innocentive.com, Zhubajie.com), crowdfunding marketplaces (e.g., GoFundMe.com,  Indegogo.com), online communities (e.g., Facebook.com, Douban.com) and more  broadly, gig economy platforms (e.g., Uber, Lyft, AirBnB). The uprising scale and  importance of such platforms has revolutionized the digital economy.    Notably, these crowd-based platforms have attracted much research attention in  the IS field. The different types of crowd-based platforms offer new opportunities to  understand information systems and related problems, such as new product development  in crowdsourcing marketplaces (Huang et al. 2014); communication and coordination in  software development (Hong and Pavlou 2016); system design in online labor markets  (Hong et al. 2014; Liang et al. 2019); social influence of contribution patterns (Burtch et  al. 2013) in crowd funding marketplaces, etc. Hereby, more innovative research is  warranted in this research topic, given the scale and societal impact of these platforms.    In this minitrack, we seek to receive submissions of papers related to these three  types of platforms below, with topics including but not limited to the following.

Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining needed services and content by soliciting voluntary  contributions in the form of an open call from a large network of individuals rather than from an  organization’s employees or suppliers (Howe, 2006). For organizations, crowdsourcing provides  an online marketplace to tap into the labor and intelligence crowd. While crowdsourcing has been  found to potentially provide new opportunities for workers (Deng & Joshi, 2016; Taylor & Joshi,  2019; Ma, Khansa, & Kim, 2018), others have identified the legal and regulatory challenges  associated with foster equitable, sustainable development through digital mediated work (Deng,  Joshi, & Galliers,  2016; Taylor, Deng, & Joshi, 2020).     During the past decade, scholars from different disciplines have paid increasing attention to  examine the design and development of crowd-based platforms and the intelligence and innovation  arising from crowdsourced contests and competitions. Studies on the technical systems and  collective intelligence are informative, but our understanding of the crowdsourcing phenomenon  cannot be complete without a comprehensive understanding of the crowd itself, the work made  available on the digital platform, work conditions, and its institutional, regulatory and societal  impacts.     More broadly, crowdsourcing contributes to the growth of the gig economy, the labor market  characterized by the prevalence of short-term contracts or freelance work as opposed to permanent  jobs, enabled by on-demand apps such as Uber and TaskRabbit. A new kind of flexible structure  in the gig economy replaces the fixed employer-employee relationship in traditional organizations  (Gandini, 2019). While the new, flexible structure in gig work affords extreme flexibility, it is also  associated with instability in income and shifting of risks to workers.  For example, the platform  companies have shifted the operation risks from the employer to the worker because the platforms  do not provide workers with training, health or retirement benefits (Bajwa, Gastaldo, Di Ruggiero,  & Knorr, 2018). Moreover, workers participating on different types of platforms, i.e., for “place- based work” or “remote work” (Heeks, 2017), are likely to experience different types of risks in  gig work. With the increasing concerns in the gig work and gig economy, it is important for both  academia and policy makers to not only understand the work conditions and the impact of gig  work on workers but also propose solutions to address the concerns.    We believe that this minitrack is well positioned to address diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)  issues in the technology-enabled and mediated crowdsourcing work environments. As discussed  above, the digital platforms provide crowd workers with open, easy, and free access to gig work,  creating  and  sustaining  the  crowdsourcing-based  online  labor  market.  However,  a  power  asymmetry exists: the crowdsourcing platforms privilege the platform owners who have the power  1    to control the digital work environments (such as the sourcing models, compensation models, and  work policies) but disadvantage the crowd workers who felt being ignored and marginalized (Deng,  Joshi,  and  Galliers,  2016).  Such  power  asymmetry  provides  opportunities  for  abuse  in  the  crowdsourcing work environments. Thus, we call for research that critically examines the current  work conditions and policies on the digital platforms and propose new work processes, platform  designs and polices to enhance the digital work environments and foster social inclusion and equity.  In this regard, our minitrack answers the call by the IS community to enhance the DEI in relation  to IS and IT development, use, and impacts (Association for Information Systems, 2021; Burton- Jones & Sarker, 2021).    Finally, it’s important for both academia and industry to better understand the impact of the- ongoing global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on work and workforce participating in both  remote and place-based gig work. In the long term, technological developments at the intersection  of crowdsourcing, gig work platforms and AI can potentially shape work at different levels.  Research on the future of work and the essential skills and abilities of future workforce will update  our knowledge and broaden our visions about the next generation of workforce.    Thus, this minitrack calls for research on the following three critical aspects of crowdsourcing, gig  work, and digital workforce. Papers presented at this HICSS-56 minitrack will be invited to extend  and be fast tracked to the Journal of Organizational Computing and Electronic Commerce  (JOCEC).     Potential issues and topics on crowd workers and digital workforce include, but are not limited to:  •  Diversity, equity, and inclusion in crowdsourcing work environments  •  Employment relations in online labor platforms  •  Ethical issues in the gig labor market and managing the gig workforce  •  Gig work and workers in the times of COVID-19  •  Gig work risk, worker behavior and performance  •  Gig workers’ participation, motivation and work-life balance  •  Gig work conditions  •  Global workforce in crowdsourcing and gig economy  •  Information technology and gig work  •  Integrating gig work into the remote workforce  •  Labor agency in the gig labor market  •  Online communities of gig workers  •  Organizational and regulatory challenges in the gig economy  •  Psychological aspects of digital platforms on workers (e.g., Technostress, Well-being)  •  Regulatory oversight of gig work platforms and labor market  •  Skill development and career pathways of gig workforce  •  Technology advancement, AI and future of work     [2] Contact information for all minitrack chairs (please indicate the primary contact).

Recent years have nevertheless seen a significant increase in cybercrime, including illegal commerce being conducted on various platforms. In the public eye, much of it is associated with the non-indexed Dark Web, but research tells us that it is likewise present on many clear web sites and being conducted via numerous social media and instant messaging services.   Rarely a day goes by without cybercrime being reported in the media. Examples include online trading in narcotics and other illicit goods and services, the hijacking of individual accounts and organizational systems, extortion, exit scams, fake investments in cryptocurrencies and even blatant information manipulation for financial gain.   This minitrack aim is to give insights and develop a theoretical and practical understanding of issues related to cybercrime without excluding any methodological approaches. We welcome conceptual, theoretical, empirical and methodological papers that enrich our understanding of illegal online practices.   Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  Trading in illicit goods and services online The use of the Dark Web as a marketplace or information sharing environment Using social media and instant messaging services for illicit trading Ransomware Phishing and scamming Cryptomarkets and cryptocurrencies  Information manipulation for commercial gain Dark Web deception, risk, security, and privacy  Differences between legal and illegal online trading Regional differences in cybercrime Investigative techniques and methods for cybercrimes  Journals for fast track opportunities, if any: N/A  Marketing plan:  Using research networks and various associations, e.g. Association of Internet Researchers; National Communication Association; International Communication Association Dark Web and addiction research communities Cybercrime research networks Grassroots activists in this area  Name, affiliation, and contact information of minitrack chair (primary contact) and co-chair(s): J.

Companies  must ensure leveraging data to optimize internal business processes and create new business opportunities. That  applies to traditional incumbents and digital natives alike. The former must ensure to stay competitive and avoid  losing touch with the changing market, for example, by using data from physical assets (e.g., machines) to offer  new digital services. The latter can leverage the green-field advantage and generate completely novel solutions  from scratch, such as establishing data ecosystems that enable different actors (e.g., public institutions, companies,  academia) to share data for reciprocal benefit. With this comes a set of challenges. For example, unlike physical  assets, data are reproducible at almost zero marginal cost and technical effort.   The track focuses on exploring the fundamentals of data ecosystems from multiple perspectives, including studies  that discover the meaning of data sharing in ecosystems for its stakeholders (e.g., data producers, providers, or  consumers) or the classification of ecosystems. We expect contributions examining issues relating to the business  value of data ecosystems within different domains (e.g., mobility, healthcare, manufacturing, logistics) and the use  of various underpinning technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence or blockchain). Complementarily, we invite  contributions exploring data sharing as well as the associated rules and governance mechanisms. Lastly, we like  to encourage submission tackling socially relevant challenges by means of data ecosystems, such as sustainability  (17 Sustainable Development Goals), security, and privacy.  The track ‘Data Ecosystems in Information Systems’ invites papers investigating the field of data ecosystems both  empirically and theoretically, such as (but not limited to):  •  Classifications of data ecosystems and data sharing mechanisms  •  Paradigmatic differences between data ecosystems and traditional business networks  •  Analysis of domain-specific characteristics of data ecosystems   •  Analysis of technology-specific characteristics of data ecosystems   •  Design and modeling of data ecosystems  •  Business models in data ecosystems  •  Impact of data ecosystems on stakeholders  •  Data sharing fundamentals  •  Data sovereignty and usage control policies in data ecosystems  •  Economic, ecological, and social sustainability of data ecosystems     Keywords: Data Ecosystems, Design Science, Data Sharing        Marketing Plan     Marketing channel        LinkedIn  We will use both our private profiles that are well connected in the community and  the corresponding profiles of our chairs to publicize the track. We plan to place three  posts each at the opening of the submission, in the middle, and two weeks apart at the  deadline. We anticipate more than 2000 unique views per post.      WKWI  Wissenschaftliche Kommission Wirtschaftsinformatik (WKWI) is the largest  association of researchers in the discipline in the German-speaking region.

Additionally, the COVID-19  pandemic demonstrates how unexpected events can disrupt entire global logistics chains in  short time. The resulting demand for change, combining sustainability and resilience  aspects, poses enormous challenges for industrial production. At the same time, the  ongoing digitalization and networking of industrial value chains – summarized as the fourth  industrial revolution or Industry 4.0 – offer new opportunities and capabilities to reach  these objectives. We see sustainability as a driver of structural change: In parallel to our  current digital transformation, we need a sustainability transformation of today's value  creation and production models into future-proof resilient approaches.     The objective of this minitrack is to foster a discussion how new information &  communication systems can foster sustainability and resilience in the next generation of  production systems. Data-enriched views on processes and an increasing information  capability (in real-time, complete, distributed) are the underlying principles of improving the  efficiency of processes and avoiding waste over the complete life cycle of products and  industrial assets. A main enabler in this regard is cross-company data spaces. They link  classic “data silos” even across company boundaries. Supported by a combination of  optimization, simulation, artificial intelligence and machine learning, new insights can be  created.      Sustainable production models utilize these data spaces to make information transparency a  central part of their value proposition. In this way, they foster organizational decision  making for more sustainable value creation. Consider, as an example, the ability to better  predict demand by analyzing different streams of market information. This allows for a  more precisely timed procurement and producing only what and when something is needed  – reducing waste on all levels of the value chain. Improved information capabilities also  enable accountability in terms of supply chain traceability and allow users to be sustainable  themselves. Another obvious option for achieving sustainability by networked data is to fully  utilize the capacity of today’s machines, enabling their more efficient usage through  continuous data-driven optimization. In this context, digital twins could become  ""sustainability twins"", i.e. digital models that are networked with the real products, and  provide information about performance, repair requirements, and possibilities for more  efficient use. The sustainability twin continuously improves operations, adapts the product  or asset to the performance actually required, and provides important insights for a more  sustainable engineering of the next product generation. Process mining and corresponding  data analytics are a core enabler in this regard.    Reducing resource consumption and making existing production setups more efficient are  just the beginning. We also need new business models, which focus on prosperity with  resource recovery instead of conventional growth with just a bit less resource consumption.  Co2-neutral production and the shift from energy management to resource efficiency is an  accepted goal in many companies today. In IT, targeted data processing as a guiding  principle is replacing an ever-growing demand for more computing capacity. Trading  emission certificates can promote more environmentally friendly production. But these  measures – while undisputedly important – increase path dependencies and focus on  existing business models, often supporting just a sustainability narrative (“greenwashing”).  Instead, a true dual paradigm shift is required: Digitization and sustainability must either  move into the center of the value proposition, or sustainability must be generated from a  digital value creation structure itself. An example for the former are digital platforms for  second-hand goods, an example for the latter ""as-a-service"" models, where value creation  shifts from the production of a good to its usage stage.     These new production and business models achieve sustainability and resilience with value  co-creation and value sharing in cross-company, open ecosystems. This requires data not  just on final products, but also on semi-finished goods, raw materials, production processes,  transportation, usage, and disposal or refurbishment. While building a data space enabling  this visibility is technically feasible today, it is difficult to motivate all actors to share the  data required – all too often, a lack of willingness to share and use data is preventing best- case scenarios. Achieving more sustainability in industry requires a complete reversal of  thinking in conventional “lock-in effects”: Sustainability demands to regard data not as an  exclusive asset of one organization, but to share data and knowledge in the ecosystem.  Corresponding governance structures are an essential component of sustainable business  models – but there still is little knowledge how to define and utilize such governance  structures fostering openness and data sovereignty.    A final challenge demanding further research is managing possible rebound effects.  Rebound effects are one of the most underestimated barriers when moving towards  sustainable production. Often, a positive environmental impact by higher efficiency and  resource productivity is offset by an increased usage. Digitization promotes  dematerialization and thus reduces resource consumption. However, building and  maintaining its technical infrastructure (e.g., data centers, cloud storage, distributed ledger  technologies) must not outweigh the possible savings. Digital photos are more  environmentally friendly than traditional prints. But as they incur little cost to the user,  many more are created and stored. In the end, the resources saved by digitalization are  partially or completely counterbalanced. In the worst case, consumption even rises above  the previous value. Car sharing platforms can lead to fewer people owning a car, but may  increase car usage instead of public transportation. Innovative digital business models,  supported by visibility and transparency through shared data, must avoid this rebound  effect by not aiming at the consumption of resources, but promoting their saving.  Transferring approaches from consumer products (nudging consumer behavior, virtual  scarcity) to the world of industry and production is an open challenge.    In this minitrack we aim to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss  novel approaches in dealing with sustainability through resilient information systems and  connected data spaces. Particularly, we invite submissions that discuss cross-organizational  aspects of data sharing, e.g., to enable analyzing issues of sustainability and resilience across  entire value chains.    As a result, areas of focus and interest of this minitrack include, but are not limited to, the  following topics:  •  Designing information systems for sustainable engineering, production, usage, and  recycle/refurbish  •  Resource efficiency through digitally supported product life extension  •  Resilience and sustainability by design  •  Resilience in digital supply networks  •  Resilience and sustainability by design  •  Reactive hybrid intelligence for dealing with unexpected disruptions  •  Data sovereignty and data cooperation for sustainability  •  Lifetime synchronization of heterogeneous cyber-physical production systems  •  Sustainability through data-enriched supply chains  •  Process mining to enable sustainability-driven data analytics  •  Digital data-driven business models as enabler of sustainability in manufacturing  •  Sustainability impact of (platform-based) production ecosystems   •  Rebound effects managing the trade-off between sustainability gains by IS and  digitalization versus resource consumption by IT      Marketing plan, i.e., how do you plan to solicit papers:    All mini track co-chairs are very well connected in social media (LinkedIn, Xing, Twitter,  where the track chairs have more than 100K direct contacts combined) and have access to  large academic communities (ACM, AOM, IEEE, VDI, CIRP), where we will share the call for  papers for this mini track. Through the advisory boards of our Cluster of Excellence Internet  of Production (https://www.iop.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~rgoi?lidx=1 ), we are connected to a large  interdisciplinary network of potential authors especially dedicated to the topics of this mini  track.  We also plan to set up a website (via GitHub pages) that contains the minitrack  description, information on the chairs, and submission information.

As visualization technology advances in recent years, these digital humans have been transforming the way we work, live, play, and learn. As a technology category they comprise both computer generated models, and virtual people generated by GANs and other AI technology that have evolved from Deep Fake statistical methods. Realistic digital humans have been deployed in multiple areas, including e-commerce and social media. In social media, human realistic digital agents have become virtual influencers. In electronic commerce, virtual agents have been deployed as digital sales assistants, fashion advisers, financial consultants and personal shoppers. In particular, digital humans will become more relevant as social media is further integrated into the retail customer experience.   There have been mini-tracks related to artificial intelligence-based assistants in the Internet and the Digital Economy track and other tracks in previous years. However, we believe our mini-track is unique and can bring new value to the HICSS community for a rapidly emerging and maturing technology category. First, one of the emphasis of our minitrack is human agent/AI visualization. The existing mini-tracks on AI agents focus on the algorithm design and data mining techniques for agents without humanlike visual representations, such as chatbots and voice recognition agents. We welcome submissions on any technology advancement to create human-realistic avatars and agents. Second, our mini-track also emphasizes the importance of investigating the behavioral and perception outcomes, uncovering the complicated interactive nature among the technology, the end user, the tasks, as well as the organizational environment, and opening the black box of the underlying cognitive processes undertaken by the end user while interacting with digital humans. Third, the adoption and use of digital humans can provide incomparable guidance to the creation of such digital characters. Our mini-track would like to invite submissions from industry and practitioners on the use and need for realistic human simulation. Such industries include but are not limited to the gaming industry, movie industry, fashion industry, and other online retailers. We suggest that this mini-track will also bridge academic research with practitioner concerns to create synergy on promoting the creation and usage of digital humans.  This is the second time we propose this mini-track at HICSS. For HICSS 55, when this minitrack was first held, we have received two submissions. We believe it takes time to cultivate a successful minitrack at HICSS. We plan to strengthen the recruitment process prior to the submission deadline to encourage authors from both academia and industries to submit at our minitrack. For HICSS 56, we set the goal of organize one or two sessions to attract innovative and forward looking empirical and applied research.  This mini-track covers a wide range of topics within this area. Submissions may focus on theory, strategy, cases, practices, methods, or anything else compelling and of great interest to the industry and the HICSS community. However, it is key that each submission convey a sense of significant importance, richness, or impact for theory, behaviors, or/and practice.  To promote our mini track, multi-media tools will be used. We plan to produce a promotional video featuring a virtual hybrid digital human to showcase researching conducted worldwide on digital humans on social media. Along with the promotional video, we will create an expert panel discussion podcast on iTunes to discuss the research topics in this evolving area. The promotion materials (video, podcast, and CFP) will also be delivered through  Posting to the IS, HCI and IT communities via email lists (such as AISWorld). Reaching out to researchers in digital human and related areas individually. Contacting industry researchers via social media groups (such as FacebookVirtual Beings) and via key blogs (such as fxguide.com).    Short description of the mini-track including topics We would like to position this mini-track as a place for researchers and practitioners from diverse background to share their research and ideas. There are a variety of important issues and topics of importance, such as new technology and visual design advancements to digital humans, the behavioral, emotional, and even physical responses of the users while interacting with digital humans, the underlying cognitive processes underlying the interactions, the impact of digital humans on the firm level or industry level, and ethical issues and societal considerations of the application of digital humans. Research could be wide ranging, such as rich descriptive statistics, theories, emergent and innovative topics, models and frameworks related to technologies and their impact on marketing, case studies, methods, qualitative research, etc. The topics include but are not limited to: Visualization technology to advance digital humans Challenges and problems with creating digital humans or scanning and sampling users. Human computer interactions, instilled with digital humans, including affective computing issues. Design of digital humans by combining human and computer cognitive power. Use of GANs and VAEs to infer digital human faces, including approaches building on ‘Deep Fakes’ technology. Analysis of machine learning, big data, data mining, and other underlying technologies and algorithms of digital humans Taxonomy of digital humans Virtual influencers and YouTube digital celebrities  Impact of digital humans on the individual level (decision making, problem solving, negotiation, and creativity/innovation) Psychological and emotional effects of interacting with realistic digital humans Biases in interacting with digital humans and biases in the digital humans deployed The use of digital humans beyond individuals and its consequences in organizations Management of deployment (e.g., corporate governance, data management) Case studies on industry adoption of digital humans Use and economic implications of digital humans in e-commerce, social media, and the combinations of multiple industries involving e-commerce and social media. Social impact and ethics related to digital humans and their use Philosophical questions surrounding the idea of ‘using’ digital humans  Attendance Our organizations endorse our involvement and will pay for our travel and registration cost to attend HICSS.

Supply chains have to cope with increasingly dynamic customer demands and a broad variety of external disturbances. More flexibility and agility are needed, processes have to be accelerated and made transparent or visible in order to enhance supply chain responsiveness, resilience and sustainability. Innovative technological solutions such as the IoT, cyber-physical systems, autonomous or collaborative robots, automated guided vehicles and drones, cloud and mobile computing, data analytics and machine learning, artificial intelligence, data lakes, digital platforms and blockchain as well as virtualization of the physical world based on digital twins and additive manufacturing can help to master the challenges and are increasingly being used. The implementation of these technologies may lead to a fundamental digital transformation of companies, supply chains and industry structures, and inter-organizational relationships. Data has to be understood as a new source of value creation. The technologies mentioned above in combination with data-driven services pave the way for a paradigm shift in supply chain management, leading to more self-organizing and self-optimizing ecosystems. In this minitrack we try to understand how digital transformation affects traditional product-oriented supply chains as well as the corresponding management activities and thus leads to the digital supply chains of tomorrow. Digitalization in general is expected to play an increasingly important role for global supply chains. The reasons for this include: the shift in values from the physical artefact to the data created by smart products, the emerging importance of digital platforms, services and business ecosystems, the displacement of industry borders, the radical change of competitive structures and power distribution, the transformation of business models and, at the end of the day, the symptomatic destruction of established structures and behavior patterns. This minitrack provides an outlet for all research focused on digital transformation of supply chains. Its focus is not primarily on pure technologies but on their applications and implications with regard to the dominant logic of supply chain configurations and value creation in a supply chain management (SCM) context. We are also interested in the driving forces for a digital transformation and the instruments and tools to master the change or to measure its progress. Therefore, we welcome research in progress or completed research papers that address applications, use cases, theories, models, methods, tools as well as other critical issues, including but not limited to: Drivers of digital transformation of supply chains Supply chain structures for smart products and smart services Visibility and transparency through the Internet of Things (IoT) Company-spanning data spaces for supply chain and business ecosystem management    Improved planning and forecasting through big data analytics and predictive analytics Decision-making based on artificial intelligence Virtualization of supply chain structures Robots, cobots and other technology drivers for process automation in supply chains Robotic Process Automation (RPA)  Role of digital platforms in supply chain structures Role of service providers (logistics, IT, communication etc.) in future supply chain structures Contribution of blockchain technologies to SCM The impact of 3D printing on value creation systems The impact of digitalization on business models and business performance  Changes in the understanding of the terms Supply Chain, SCM, Ecosystem Models, methods and tools for the digitalization of companies and supply chains Barriers and challenges for the digitalization of supply chains Legal frameworks for the digitalization of supply chains Relationship between data security and digitalization of supply chains Requirements for the digitalization of supply chains in the extended enterprise Relationship management in digital supply chains Contributions of digitalization to “green” sustainable supply chains Emerging technologies’ applications in last-mile deliveries Human factors in the digital transformation of supply chains Marketing plan: Chairs and Co-chairs will send the minitrack to the global research communities for Logistics, SCM and Business Informatics as well as to their personal research networks directly after publication. Experts on “digital supply chains” within the different research communities will be identified and addressed personally. The experts will be asked to forward the minitrack proposal to other relevant researchers in order to create a pyramiding effect. National and international research projects on digitalization will be identified and the research teams will be asked for contributions. Multiple reminders will be sent in order to increase the response flow.

It goes beyond simple technology adoption, requiring new methods, models, and tools enabling  data-driven business. These changes frequently imply new strategies, identities, new business models, and  adapted  capabilities  to  deal  with  people,  technology,  and  processes  that  advocates  new  ways  of  management and change management. This minitrack aims to discuss how organizations and technology  influence each other during digital transformation. Also, to investigate how organizations are dealing with  the  complexity  generated  by  digital  transformation  at  different  levels  simultaneously.  Theoretical,  methodological, or applied papers are welcome. These may include papers presenting a real case or cases in  any activity sector, for example, papers on - strategies or tools helping organisations to deal with their digital  transformation; practices involved in digital transformation; challenges during the transformation process;  metrics and indicators adopted to measure the success or degree of digital transformation; or other relevant  topics in the area.   Proposed topics include, but are not limited to:  •  DT challenges, drivers, adoption, and barriers  •  DT human resources / technology / corporate strategies  •  DT key performance indicators / success factors / maturity  •  Comparisons between industries and countries  •  Impact on work and changing roles e.g. Data Scientists, Data Citizens, Chief Digital Officers, etc.  •  Frameworks of analyses such as dynamic capabilities, disruption, competitive advantage  •  Methodological reflections such as sociotechnical / sociomaterial approaches or design science  approaches  Research questions, some examples include (but are not limited to):  •  How to prepare middle managers for digital transformation?   •  How to measure the degree of DT?  •  What are strategies to better cope with challenges of DT?  •  How does DT affect corporate strategy and vice versa?  •  How does analytical competence and capability influence DT?  •  Which methodological lenses are needed to come to a higher level of theorization of DT?  •  How to adapt change management to better support successful DT?  •  How does data-driven business and DT influences business models?  •  How are existing business facing DT of the supply chain and partners?   •  How digital supply chain compels organizations to embark in the digital transformation journey?    We expect contributions that will address relevant research questions to the DT process and business model  changes. Exchanges and interactions among authors during the conference will promote fruitful discussions,  perhaps new collaborations. As DT draws heavily from related research domains and seems to be under- theorized in itself, this minitrack will contribute to some theoretical evolution of this relevant research topic.    Journals for fast-track opportunities: There is no opportunity defined by now.  Marketing plan: Similar to the previous years, since 2019 we will share the minitrack call through personal  contacts and newsletters, as well as through established contact with former track participants. In addition,  we will employ our network from other conferences (e.g., ECIS and AMCIS), in which we are co-chairing other  minitracks. We will publish the call and the introduction to the minitrack on Researchgate and in other lists.  Also, we will use LinkedIn to distribute our call. On the reviewer side, we will ask colleagues in our networks,  who have already served as reviewers and accepted to serve again. In addition, we can also ask participants  from last years’ session to serve as reviewers.

Despite the  differences between approaches to esports, all emphasize its technological specificity and  competitiveness. In the last decade, esport has ceased to be seen solely as entertainment for  the youth and has become the fastest-growing sports area. This view is supported by the  increase in the number of events organized, their popularity among millions of viewers, and  the growing number and professionalization of gamers. Traditional sports are still bigger than  the biggest esports, making more revenue or player salaries. However, esports is quickly  catching up, given the growing number of broadcasted games, tournament prize pools, and  increasing advertising potential of esports games. Despite the increasing popularity of esports,  the research is still in its nascency. After an initial descriptive stage, the focus shifts from  explaining what esports is to a more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon.     This minitrack aims to provide insight into esports’ theoretical development and practical  understanding without excluding any methodological approach or scientific disciplines.  Conceptual, theoretical, empirical, and methodological contributions that enrich our  understanding of esports are welcome.     Given the diverse goals of this minitrack, possible topics include, but are not limited to:    •  Business, e.g. discovering esports consumers’ motivations; designing effective  marketing tools; understanding players’/esports’ networks and organizations;  gamers/fans as consumers.  •  Cognitive Science/Psychology, e.g. studying factors influencing athletes’  performance; their abilities and skills; cognitive and behavioral differences between  athletes.   •  IT, e.g. using game telemetry, biometrics, user-generated data, or text mining to study  esports, e.g. team dynamics, interactions of players; in-game performance.  •  Law, e.g. copyright issues   •  Sociology, e.g. gamers’ and athletes’ interactions and identities; live events and  streaming dynamics; gender issues (gender gap).  •  Media Studies, e.g. relations between esports, traditional sports, and the media; offline  spaces versus live-streaming, understanding esports in terms of virtual versus real;  how technology mediates gaming, and how esports’ communities fit here.  •  Sports Science, e.g., comparing esports and ‘traditional’ sports; esports as ‘real’,  ‘genuine’ sports or new quality.           Journals for fast track opportunities, if any:      Journal of Electronic Gaming and Esports       Marketing plan:    •  Using research networks and various associations, e.g. Esports Research Network;  Association of Internet Researchers; National Communication Association;  International Communication Association, European Communication Research and  Education Association.  •  Esports research journals (e.g. JEGE), conferences and communities.  •  Grassroots activism in this area.

Content can be created by companies (FGC/PGC), consumers (UGC/CGC) or by machines and artificial intelligence (MGC).  Consumers consult content as a source of inspiration when making purchasing decisions. Source criteria, media format, valence as well as depth and breadth impact the helpfulness and credibility of content. From a business perspective UGC plays an important role in the customer journey, influencing purchasing decisions, raising brand awareness, brand loyalty as well as perceived quality. Moreover, UGC is a valuable data source informing companies about customer preferences and motivations. Analytics play an important role in the understanding of customer preferences and recommender systems help to suggest the right user/content combination. Papers dealing with the creation, usage, management, analytics and impact of content for digital economy are focusing on the following topics:  -	Motivations for UGC creation -	User engagement - 	Machine and artificial intelligence created content (MGC) - 	Analytics (sentiment, text mining, etc.) -	Influencer management -	Content type and channel differences -	Platform and format characteristics -	Interplay between UGC, FGC, and MGC -	Digital content marketing -	Content management (initiation, filtering and consolidation) -	Recommender systems for content -	Outcomes of FGC / UGC / MGC Marketing plan, i.e., how do you plan to solicit papers  Soliciting via ZHAW partner universities :  Including personalized Email campaign Social media posts on LinkedIn, Twitter and other appropriate networks Promotion on ResearchGate, Mendeley-Groups, Academia.edu Associations: Usage of associations network in Switzerland and EU Usage of our global mailing list of researchers in human-computer interaction in electronic marketing Journals for fast track opportunities, if any:  None (work in progress)  Name, affiliation, and contact information of minitrack chair  (primary contact) and co-chair(s).

The aim of this mini-track is to provide a forum for HCI researchers to discuss a broad range of issues related to the design of user interfaces. Appropriate papers for the HCI mini-track may draw on a wide spectrum of research methodologies including, but not limited to, behavioral methods (e.g., case study, experimentation, survey, action research), neurophysiological tools (e.g., fMRI, eye tracking, skin conductance response, and input devices such as the computer mouse, touch screen and typing dynamics), and design science approaches. Accordingly, papers may draw on various reference disciplines to inform design, such as computer science, information systems, consumer behavior, behavioral economics, psychology, organizational sciences, and neuroscience. Moreover, papers that help to bridge academic research and industry practice are welcome.   Given the diverse goals of this mini-track, there are many appropriate topics; possible topics include, but are not limited to:  Analysis, design, development, evaluation, and use of information systems  Guidelines and standards for interface design Design of online choice architectures Web-based user interface design and evaluation  Design and evaluation issues for mobile devices and m-Commerce Interface design for FinTech applications  Interface design for group and other collaborative environments  Design issues related to the elderly, the young, and special needs populations Interface issues in the design and development of innovative interaction technologies Novel forms of authentication and authorization (e.g., using mousing or typing dynamics) Using information and sensors to detect user states (e.g., emotion, cognitive conflict) and create more intelligent interfaces The impact of interfaces on attitudes, emotion, perception, behavior, productivity, and performance Impact of digital nudges on online judgment and decision making Impact of behavioral economics principles and website design implementation on privacy and trust Website designs/elements that encourage rational thinking and/or nudge users into certain behaviors Implications and consequences of technological change on individuals, groups, society, and socio-technical units  Behavioral, neurophysiological, and design aspects of human-computer interaction Neuroscientific approaches to human-computer interaction Factors influencing usability (i.e., friction reduction), ease-of-use and the overall user experience Information systems usability engineering Issues related to teaching HCI courses  Ethical issues related to the capture of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), behavioral biometric data, and nudging  Track Justification: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a dynamic field that has attracted researchers, educators, and practitioners from various disciplines. HCI has gained attention during recent years due to the rapid development and advancement in information and computer technology. To better interact with and use advanced technology, we need to better understand users, their tasks within different contexts, and the interplay among users, tasks, and contexts/environments.     In a variety of computing disciplines, HCI issues and research questions have been investigated over a long period of time. HCI or Human Factors studies in the information systems discipline, for example, have been concerned with the ways humans interact with information, technologies, and tasks, especially in business, managerial, organizational, and cultural and social contexts. There is a natural overlap between HCI design issues within organizational contexts and a broad range of other contexts (e.g., education, e-government, health care, and so on).   The high level of interest exhibited by HCI scholars as well as practitioners is evidenced in many ways:   The HCI mini-track was first introduced at HICSS-40 and has continued to attract high quality papers and an interested audience. Given the apparent interest and demand for HCI research at HICSS, we expect a similar number of submissions for the HCI mini-track next year. Due to the increased interest in HCI research, the AIS Journal of Transactions in Human-Computer Interaction (THCI) has asked the co-chairs to forward papers from the HICSS-54 for fast tracking possibilities. With the primary co-chair serving as SE for THCI, we expect the same for HICSS-55.  The high-level participation in HCI specific events sponsored by the AIS SIGHCI (please refer to http://sighci.org/ for more information). The high level of participation in the HCI mini-tracks/tracks at AMCIS and ICIS 2002 – 2020, sponsored by AIS SIGHCI.  HCI research has become a major focus at research conferences for a variety of disciplines and professional societies (e.g., IEEE, ACM, AIS).    Marketing the Mini-Track:  The HCI research community has grown substantially in the past several years. Due to this growth we have successfully marketed this mini-track using the following channels: The AIS HCI Special Interest Group (SIG) has a biannual newsletter in which the HCI mini-track will be prominently featured. The HCI mini-track will also be featured on the SIG-HCI webpage. An email database of past authors and reviewers of the HCI mini-track has been compiled and will be used to advertise a call for papers. The HCI mini-track has also created relationships with the AIS Transactions on HCI for possible fast track opportunities for the best papers of the mini-track. These relationships to journals add to the appeal of our mini-track.     Further, given the broad interest in HCI research, we intend to publish the call for papers (CFP) for this mini-track widely to attract both a good mix of HCI-oriented researchers as well as a wide range of other contributors including practitioners (e.g., Web designers and developers) and academics from other disciplines (e.g., HCI, Information Sciences, Applied Psychology, Neuroscience). We believe that the diversity of contributors will help facilitate cross-fertilization of research ideas and enhance the advancement of the field.

It has fundamentally changed organization, management, and  work processes.  By adopting, adapting, or developing Information Systems (IS),  hospitality and tourism organizations and their use of technology continually  undergo a substantial transformation often referred to as “digital transformation”.  Disruptive business models, with external and sharing platforms, are developing  through the transformation at the same time as the global firms and leading  trademarks integrates new models to survive in even more competitive markets.   As a result, information systems, business models, and business processes are  continually analyzed, rethought, and changed.     A few large international actors are dominating in hotel bookings and new actors  have disrupted how consumers can travel, e.g., by booking peoples home instead of  hotel rooms. Furthermore, the hospitality and tourism industry are one of the  industries that have suffered from the COVID-19 pandemic as the need for social  distancing occasionally have shut down the entire industry. As we are beginning to  move into a new phase of the pandemic, where societies are opening up again, there  are digital transformation and the challenges of Covid-19 that are reshaping  conditions for the hospitality and tourism industry.     Thus, there is a need to develop practical and conceptual knowledge on the disruptive  changes in the hospitality and tourism industry, not at least in relation to the “new  normal” induced by the COVID-19 lockdowns. Digital transformation take different  forms like when (i) new competitors have entered the market as corporations within  the platform economy like Airbnb and affect hotel guests’ behaviours; (ii) social  media platforms and rating platforms such as TripAdvisor have changed how  customers interact with hotels and change power relations between the customers  and the hotels (Sigala and Gretzel, 2017); (iii) third-party platforms like Booking.com  selling hotel rooms have had a severe impact on the industry (Buhalis et al, 2017).  For this mini-track, we seek to attract research contributions that extend existing  research by focusing on socio-technical, organizational, managerial and/ or  individual challenges of digital disruption and digital transformation in the  hospitality and tourism industry. We welcome conceptual, empirical, and design- oriented contributions on macro, meso and micro levels of analysis for this mini- track. Potential topics include:  •  Digital business strategy  •  Digital business model development  •  Big data analysis for strategic decision making in hospitality and tourism  •  Platform economy in hospitality and tourism  •  Local and regional economic development relating to digitalization of  hospitality and tourism,  •  Quality management strategies and reviews in hospitality and tourism,  •  Social media and online reviews  •  Digital change management for the future of the tourism and hospitality  industry  •  Strategic digital innovation for the tourism and hospitality industry  •  Digital communication and guest decision making  •  Technology and contact in tourism and hospitality  •  Crisis recovery and digitalization in tourism and hospitality  •  Other related topics    Mintrack Co-chairs:    Karin Högberg (primary contact)  University West, Sweden   Karin.hogberg@hv.se    Elin Wihlborg  University of Linköping, Sweden   and University West, Sweden   elin.wihlborg@liu.se    Ulrike Gretzel  University of Southern California  gretzel@usc.edu      Marketing plan    Together, the three co-chairs have a wide network of researchers in the IS research  field and the hospitality and tourism field.

Not only the economies and the societies but also people’s personal lives have been  influenced by this new and ever-emerging era of our history. While the digital age has made  it possible to provide novel services and solutions for the end-users, it has also caused serious  concerns in different individual and societal levels, such as issues regarding online privacy,  algorithmic  bias,  fairness  and  accountability  of  information  systems,  transparency,  governance, and explainability of information systems, end-user manipulations, fake news,  traceability, etc. The development of human-centric and end-user empowering information  systems can be one approach towards “digital sustainability” since they enable individuals to  influence  how  their  data  is  used,  by  whom,  and  for  which  purpose.  Many  novel  and  personalized  services  are  emerging  in  this  direction,  which  make  the  digital  economy  sustainable, i.e. a positive place that focuses on human users.  This minitrack aims to attract research that advances the understanding of human-centricity  and end-user empowerment in a sustainable digital economy. As the transformation is  multidimensional in nature, the minitrack adopts an interdisciplinary perspective, which  considers human-centricity and end-user empowerment across application domains (e.g.  software development, digital commerce, healthcare, administration, mobile apps, social  media, and online services) and disciplines (e.g. economics, ecology, computer science,  sociology). Among the relevant topics are:  •  Characteristics and design of sustainable human-centric information systems  •  Evaluation of information systems from a human-centric perspective  •  Co-creation and co-production of human-centric sustainable information systems  •  Analysis and design of technologies (e.g. AI, Blockchain) that empower end-users  •  Design of human-centric end-user agents, AI and machine learning  •  Fairness, transparency, accountability and controllability of information systems  •  Legal, social, political or economic aspects of human-centricity in information systems  •  Identity, privacy and consent management systems    •  Business value of human-centric and/or user empowered solutions  •  Sociotechnical and political aspects of human-centricity in information systems  •  Digital nudging for increasing social or ecological responsibilities  •  Ethical concerns regarding human-centricity and/or sustainability  •  The role of platforms in digital sustainability   •  Human-centricity and sustainability in platform economy, shared economy, circular  economy, and digital economy  •  Study of gaps, barriers, enablers, drivers, and concerns related to human-centricity  and sustainability in digital systems, ecosystems, and environments  •  Ubiquitous, pervasive, and/or ambient human-centricity in digital environments  •  Study of human’s perception, experience, or interactions in digital environments  •  COVID-19’s impact on human-centricity or sustainability of information systems    Marketing plan, i.e., how do you plan to solicit papers                 The chairs plan to distribute the call for papers in their communities as well as via the list  servers  (e.g.  AISWorld,  OCISNET,  WI).  Moreover,  over  the  last  years  a  community  of  researchers has shaped around this minitrack-series. We will also distribute the call within  this community. The chairs are positive that the minitrack topic attracts contributions since it  covers one of the most important research fields of our time.     Journals for fast-track opportunities, if any                 - Electronic Markets  Selected papers will be invited for a fast-track in Electronic Markets – The International  Journal on Networked Business.

The Internet of People emerging with the increase of embedded and wearable technologies (fitness trackers, fashion pieces, embedded medical devices, etc.), which extend people’s roles from being mere users and observers of the Internet to becoming part of the Internet. Other examples of the IoP include the use of  face recognition, or other biometric data used to identify and authenticate a person in everyday scenarios. The Internet of Plants transforming food and agriculture systems with connected digital and data-driven technologies. Smart farming, for example, combines artificial intelligence with Internet-connected equipment to collect, process, and exchange meteorological, microbial, productivity, economic, and all sorts of other data.  The Internet of Everything (IoE) materializes when Internets of people, plants, and things converge, bringing together a new, networked world of ever-expanding data streams.

Description The Metaverse, Smart Contracts, and Non-Fungible Tokens (“NFT’s”) have captured the public’s attention and are beginning to disrupt a wide range of social structures. They allow for complex contracts that afford information sharing with elaborate rules, new opportunities to monetize creative work, novel organizational structures, and untold future benefits for those who invest the time and effort required to integrate them into their business lives. However, many who engage with NFT’s are naïve regarding the assets that they represent, and this may have created investment bubbles that will cause harm. It is possible that these new virtual technologies enable criminal networks to collect and launder illicit real-world currency. This mini-track is dedicated to the examination of the social and economic effects of the emergence of the Metaverse, Smart Contracts, and NFT’s. Topics include, but are not limited to: Virtual Real Estate Metaverse Property and Ownership Harassment, Bullying, and Abuse in the Metaverse Virtual Community Inclusivity Issues and Opportunities Decentralized Finance and (DeFi) and Yield Farming Health Records Control with Smart Contracts Virtual Investment Bubbles Why NFT’s may or may not be a bubble.

Digitization of production and logistics systems is in  full swing, and the B2B sector is considered a lucrative market for establishing profitable platforms.  However, only 3% of industrial companies are estimated to have adopted an effective platform  strategy. Using novel technologies and approaches could lower the entry barriers for industrial  companies to participate in the platform economy and spur digitization. For example, open-source  technologies (e.g., Apache Kafka, Eclipse Vorto) and data-driven artifacts (e.g., smart services or  digital twins) help monitor, analyze, and optimize productional and logistical operations.  Furthermore, these tools provide an excellent level of transparency and foster trust. Yet, the  platform ecosystems and data-driven artifacts depend highly on individual use-cases. They have  direct implications on the technical architectures and the underlying business models.   A particular emphasis of this minitrack is the inclusion of novel technologies, such as blockchain  technology or digital twins, to facilitate digital business models or applications and foster the growth  of sustainable and prosperous B2B platform ecosystems. This minitrack aims at research on  innovative progress in the field of digitization regarding logistics and production systems. The first  focus is on novel approaches, such as open-source development as a strategic tool to conceptualize  platform ecosystems and data-driven artifacts. The second focus emphasizes innovative business  models to enable their development and instantiation. This includes papers on empirical studies from  industrial contexts and theoretical works, which further enhance the overall canon of research.  Additionally, reviews are welcomed under the condition that they provide novel insights.   The challenges of platform ecosystems and their data-driven artifacts include questions about the  underlying concepts and architectures, data sharing and interoperability, processes for data analysis  and system optimization, as well as data sovereignty and data governance. Hence, this minitrack  searches for papers that tackle these challenges and provide novel and innovative insights on open  platform ecosystems and data-driven artifacts:   Consequently, topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  •  Service systems and platform concepts in production and logistics  •  Business models for platform ecosystems and data-driven artifacts  •  The strategic use of open-source in production and logistics (e.g., concepts and business  models)  •  Architectures for data-driven artifacts  •  Data acquisition, preparation, and storage techniques   •  Design principles & procedure models for the industrial usage  •  Realizations of synchronization between the real world and digital world  •  Use-case based empirical studies   •  Smart data models (harmonization of data for portability for different applications)  •  Integration of connecting secure data spaces using standardized infrastructure (e.g., IDSA or  Gaia-X)  •  The use of novel technologies (e.g., digital twins, blockchain) in industrial platform  ecosystems     1    HICSS – 56 Call for Minitrack Proposal  Marketing/Dissemination plan:  The strategy for marketing and dissemination addresses academic and practice-oriented  communities.

The strategic role of data as an essential raw  material for social and economic activities gives rise to new opportunities and challenges for organizing  and innovating. Organizations are encouraged to transform and adopt data strategies that enhance their  competitiveness to thrive in this landscape (El-Dardiry, Dinkova, & Overvest, 2021; European  Commission, 2020). However, detailed insights and guidance remain scarce on how to approach this  transformation and what the effects are on, e.g., privacy issues, stakeholder trust, business models,  frameworks, public policy, and governance structures.   Although data has become a strategic resource for many organizations (Wiener, Saunders, & Marabelli,  2020), many large-scale data exchanges initiatives fail for a vast host of reasons (Aaen, Nielsen, &  Carugati, 2021). For example, datasets exchanged among organizations and possible uses of the data are  less predictable, as data re-use in novel contexts creates pitfalls for organizations (Aaen et al., 2021).  Furthermore, in processing and extracting value from data, organizations have to confront a landscape  of complex socio-political considerations when exchanging sensitive data (Vassilakopoulou, Skorve, &  Aanestad, 2019). This opens new governance forms, risks, privacy, business models, and information  systems design as organizations adapt to the data economy. For example:  -  How do the distinct characteristics of data re-shape our thinking of platform evolution?  -  What new types of privacy-enhancing business models emerge?   -  How can data platforms and new launch strategies emerge for data-driven business models?  -  How can data platforms ignite new forms of private-public partnerships?  -  How can data platforms be governed to promote privacy?  -  How can stakeholders in a data ecosystem be sure about the reliability and authenticity of the  datasets?  -  What new tensions emerge as organizations re-orient and transform to the data economy?  We welcome theoretical or empirical papers that advance our understanding of the new forms of  organizing in the data economy. We call for papers that advance our understanding of the distinct  nature of data and its impacts on privacy, business models, and governance of platforms through  quantitative, qualitative, or mixed research approaches.

Global  lockdowns,  caused  by  COVID-19,  has  accelerated  our  dependence on digital shopping and online social networks to support this shopping. Global social  commerce sales is expected to reach $1.2 trillion by 2025. OSN are increasingly being used to obtain  information, opinions, recommendations, and comparisons and to view discussions to make digital  shopping  decisions.  Often  consumers  are  faced  with  purchase  dilemmas  and  there  are  many  questions in one’s mind that could  potentially affect the outcome of the purchase decision.  With the ubiquity of recommender and comparison systems in digital social commerce engines and  multi-sided platforms like Amazon, Alibaba, eBuy, Buy.com, and Facebook, more studies are appearing  with regard to online information search fueling the purchasing power of shoppers. Online social media  such as blogs, wikis, forums, and social networks are significantly impacting the shopping behaviours in  all demographics.   How shopping decisions are taken with the support of OSN and how these networks influence purchase  behavior has not been explored sufficiently in research. Although the usage of OSN is growing rapidly,  there is a poor understanding of how OSN can provide support and influence purchase decisions in  general.  The objective of this mini-track is to obtain insights and develop theoretical and practical understanding  on topics and issues related to the influence of OSN on consumption orientated shopping decisions.  We welcome conceptual, theoretical, and empirical papers that enrich our understanding of OSN and  its design and how they support, influence and manipulate shopping decisions. All methodological  approaches are welcome.    Topics of interest in the context of social shopping include but are not limited to:    •  Shopping Decision Making and Decision Support  •  Impact of COVID-19 on social commerce   •  Social experiences and engagement   •  Co-creation of value on multisided platforms  •  Group shopping sites, communities and marketplaces  •  Influence, persuasion, and peer pressure  •  Market manipulation and incentives  •  Advertising, marketing and recommender systems  •  e-commerce, mobile commerce, and social commerce  •  Shopping gamification and shopping games  •  Consumerism, compulsive and addictive shopping  •  Fraud, deception, governance, risk, compliance, security and privacy  •  Gen-X, Y, Z, millennial shopping  •  Age, gender, and demographics  •  OSN post purchase cognitive dissonance  •  Processes, systems, tools and technologies to support social commerce      Mini-track Chairs:    Gabrielle Peko – Primary contact  Gabrielle Peko is a faculty member at the Department of Information Systems and Operations  Management, University of Auckland Business School.

"HICSS-56","KS","Knowledge Innovation and Entrepreneurial Systems","11a850ff-2eb4-4d30-812b-4226b1d6ace4","The Technical, Socio-Economic, and Ethical Aspects of AI","Proposed Mini-track for HICSS-56:   The Technical, Socio-Economic and Ethical Aspects of AI  Under the track: Knowledge Innovation and Entrepreneurial Systems  [1] Description of a minitrack (If your proposal is accepted, this minitrack description will be posted on the conference website and used as a Call for Papers for your minitrack.)  Augmented Intelligence is a new perspective to look at the artificial intelligence (AI), social computing, machine learning, big data, data mining, and related areas. It describes a system that consists of both artificial intelligence agents and human agents. Compared to the traditional AI whose ultimate goal is to replicate human intelligence, Augmented Intelligence aims to augment human intelligence that includes not only the cognitive intelligence, but also emotional intelligence, social intelligence, and physical intelligence. It has a clear emphasis that humanity, not machines, is the core of this scientific inquiry. In recent years, more and more practitioners and researchers start to accept this more holistic view of AI and to demonstrate that the ultimate goal of AI is not to replace human but to augment human. Augmented Intelligence describes a hybrid system of not only the artificial intelligence agents, but also the human agents, therefore opening up new research opportunities not only for researchers from technical fields, but also for researchers in behavioral science, social science, organization science, human-computer interaction and many other fields.  1.1 The Technical Aspect of AI The technological advancements in computer science and information systems have presented AI as a new type of aid to human workers. AI can automate simple, repetitive tasks and allow human workers to work on creative tasks. In the business setting, by applying machine learning to natural language processing (NLP), AI can help its human counterparts improve the workflows in sales and customer sales management by analyzing the tone of voice and verbiage used on a call. The International Data Corporation (IDC) forecasts that AI will unleash unprecedented levels of workplace productivity, boost global revenues by $121 billion over the next five years and generate more jobs than it will replace. In healthcare, AI assists radiologists with image interpretation by bringing the relevant information out of the electronic medical record and presenting it to them in a meaningful way to better inform their clinical judgment. AI also facilitates innovations and the creation of intellectual products. For example, a paper published in this mini-track in 2021 (Li, Xie & Sha, 2021) studies how to use deep generative network to assist engineers to come up with innovative car designs that also have optimized aerodynamic performance.  1.2 The Socio-Economic Aspect of AI Nowadays business practitioners are scrutinizing socio-economic aspects of AI and exploring new opportunities through innovation spillovers. For instance, if AI is used in conjunction with experienced farmers, it could prevent the unpredictability of weather and soil conditions, thereby reducing farmers’ costs and boosting profits. In the financial sector, AI robot-enabled service helps consultants to complete repetitive tasks, allowing them to concentrate on more judgement-based procedures and customer service. With the growing need for social computing, researchers should study how AI can drive the digital economy, while at the same time solving societal problems. AI is also enhanced by a novel computing paradigm, the social computing. Such artifacts as social media, blogs, social bookmarking, and wiki generate a vast amount of data, the ""big data,"" which enhances the human intelligence in acquiring, assimilation, and/or sharing (i.e., storing and retrieving social information). It also provides valuable training data set for the AI agents. AI is growing to be an integral part of people’s daily work and personal life. AI software programs and AI-enabled robots will become more common in the workplace. In people’s personal life, AI assistant such as Siri, Amazon Echo & Alexa, Google assistant, AI-enabled smart home is becoming a significant member of people’s family. In these contexts, human-AI interaction, collaboration, and trust are all important research topics. Several important questions such as “how to integrate human skills and intelligence with AI to facilitate human-AI symbiosis?” and “how to train AI agents to correspond with human competencies?” remain unsolved.  1.3 The Ethical Aspect of AI Ethical concerns have arisen in the development and deployment of AI systems. Computer and data scientists have or will encounter ethical issues such as biases in the building of machine learning models and stereotypes in the development of robots. For example, how can we ensure if a training data for a machine learning model is unbiased? What are the defining scopes, measurements, and prevention strategies of biases during the development and deployment of an AI system? How can human values be imported and accounted for in a fair manner in the design of AI systems? In discussing the ethics involved in the development and use of AI, scholars raise the concerns about insufficient distinction between the systems based on big data analytics (BDA) and those based on AI; they call for more effort to differentiate between BDA and AI as well understand potential risks and biases associated with the deployment of BDA-based and AI systems. In health care, for example, by using personal health data for AI algorithms, patients may suffer from privacy invasion, fraud, algorithmic bias, and information leakage. Several questions remain unanswered, such as how can health data governance mitigate cybersecurity risks? How transparent should AI healthcare systems be in terms of data use and algorithm management? One approach to minimizing AI bias is to focus on design framework. Value sensitive design (VSD) is a value-oriented design methodology commonly adopted in human–computer interaction; it seeks to understand how human values (e.g., welfare, accountability, autonomy, freedom from bias) can be accounted for in the design of computer technologies; . While Augmented Intelligence brought us the promising prospect to use the power of machine learning to uncover creative insights in fields such as science and healthcare, it’s important for us to consider and incorporate human values in the design of AI systems. The VSD framework has been proposed in the ethical considerations of micro-task crowdsourcing platform design . Likewise, we should not underestimate the potential ethical concerns arising in the adoption and use of AI for intelligence augmentation. Researchers should continue to study how to avoid the risk of constructing machine intelligence that mirrors a narrow and privileged vision of society with its biases and stereotypes.  1.4 Potential Topics  This mini-track welcomes papers in all formats including empirical studies, design, theory, theoretical framework, case studies, and etc. In addition to the perspectives above, this minitrack welcomes any studies that investigate Augmented Intelligence from both technical perspectives and social behavioral perspectives.   Potential topics include, but are not limited to: AI and social computing AI, big data and business analytics AI and knowledge management AI, digital inclusion and social inclusion AI and future of work AI in digital economy AI in healthcare BDA-based systems and AI-based systems Human–AI hybrids  Trust towards AI  Users’ fear of AI Use of robots and the impacts on workplace Biases in machine learning models and best practices Biases in robotics and best practices Business applications of AI systems Value-Sensitive Design and AI system design Ethical issues in AI development and use Organizational adoption and use of AI Regulations and public policies related to AI   [2] Contact information for all minitrack chairs (please indicate the primary contact).

The analysis of digitalization and digital artifact characteristics is crucial for instance for entrepreneurial and internationalizing firms, as the shift towards digitalization enables a more efficient and effective knowledge exchange that is pivotal for global business practice and sustained business performance in foreign endeavors. This is particularly relevant for firms targeting global markets since their inception a.k.a. “Born Globals” and for those doing so through digital infrastructures and ecosystem since their foundation “Born Digitals”. Success of their entrepreneurial activities, international business operations, management and marketing is depending on effective learning and knowledge coordination that yearly increases also as an effect of the ever more permanent changes introduced by Covid-19 pandemic to global business. Our minitrack covers aspects related to entrepreneurship, marketing, management, international business, digitalization, knowledge intensive firms like born digitals, and the role of information systems within these contexts. Given the increasing calls for research looking at the shifts in global knowledge innovation and entrepreneurial systems introduced by digital business and especially yielding from the pandemic, our mini-track invests a topic area that besides theoretical has an ever increased practical relevance, and thus will appeal to a much broader audience of academics and practitioners. We expect the submissions to follow this increasing trend. Consequently, our methodological and theoretical standpoints contemplate qualitative, quantitative, and mixed method research approaches, where cross-pollination of fields of research is particularly relevant. We welcome papers from researchers as well as practitioners. Potential topics in our minitrack may include, but are not limited to: Digitalization in the context of entrepreneurial, internationalizing firms or global organizations The role of digital artifacts in new entrepreneurial ventures, international new ventures, born globals, born digitals and other entrepreneurial firms Born digital firms, being digital from inception and featuring a digital infrastructure Business models of born digitals and internationalizing firms The role of cultural differences in managing and designing international customer relationship and other international marketing activities in the digitalized world Digital platforms in the context of international business and born digitals Managing global diversity and sustainability through digitalization and sharing economy Practitioner papers and field studies in topics above Changes spurring from the Covid-19 pandemic and impacting the global management activities of international entrepreneurial ventures"

However, this internationalisation raises fundamental questions around culture, nations’  sovereignty, politics, society, jurisdiction and other non-technical areas. Further, cybersecurity has the  potential to cause serious conflicts on international level.   The ongoing and accelerating industrial adoption of the IoT also affects cybersecurity capacity and changes  the requirements of international cybersecurity functions.  Countries are adopting these technologies with  different existing cybersecurity and technological maturity levels, which has the potential to increase the  digital divide.  It creates additional challenges to cybersecurity internationally, if some countries adopt these  safety-critical technologies without necessary security maturity. Another critical international aspect is supply chain security. Relevant factors include risks to supply chains  from cybersecurity attacks and increased attack vectors through deliberately introduced vulnerabilities and  back-doors into systems.  This minitrack explores research into very topical and pressing issues of international aspects of  cybersecurity across all relevant dimensions, including law, education, standards, defense, culture and  society, technical functions, supply chain security, policies and international agreements.   Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  Challenges for international cybersecurity agreements  Technical cybersecurity functions on international and regional level  Culture and society of cybersecurity  International computer emergency response  Contextualisation of cybersecurity solutions   Cultural adaption of cybersecurity education  National and international cybersecurity capacity maturity  Role of international agreements and political forums  Critical issues around regional digital development    Cybercrime  Cybersecurity consequences of digital transformation  Cyber stability and responsible state behaviour in cyberspace  Challenges arising from the adoption of emerging technologies   International trends in aspects of cybersecurity capacity  Equitable access to cybersecurity technologies and services Journals for fast track opportunities, if any We currently explore options for fast track opportunities with related journals, such as the Electronic Journal  of Information Systems in Develoing Countries, the Journal for Cyber Policy, the Journal for Cybersecurity,  and Computers & Security.

The goal of the Judgement, Big Data-Analytics and Decision-making mini-track is to monitor and advance our knowledge of the convergent technologies of Big Data and analytics and their role in augmenting knowledge for better management decision-making. The emphasis of the track is on the humanistic aspects of knowledge innovation, by investigating how data-analytics, and big data analytics in particular, can be used to support human judgement and organizational knowledge.  Creating, gathering, analyzing and judging reliable data and information, and more importantly, transforming them into actionable knowledge is becoming increasingly critical in decision-making (Intezari & Gressel, 2017; Nicolas, 2004; Abedin et al, 2018). Equally important is the need to mitigate the increasingly harmful effects of misinformation and disinformation. Human judgement, based on experience and knowledge, plays an important role in all facets of decision-making, but may be incomplete in certain decision situations. The study of the transformation of data into useful information, while disregarding misinformation and disinformation, and eventually transforming them into knowledge and wisdom through the use of increasingly sophisticated analytics for management decision making is an important, emerging field of research (Pauleen & Wang, 2017) and deserves further study.  This mini track welcomes empirical research adopting quantitative, qualitative and design science methodologies, as well as conceptual papers that offer theoretical insights into the human- and knowledge-centric aspects of analytics, big data and decision-making. While technology plays a centric role in the research relevant to this mini-track, overly technical or purely mathematical and algorithmic papers are out of scope of this mini-track.  Potential topics that this mini track will address are (but not limited to): Knowledge innovation through emergent and convergent technologies (including Big Data and analytics) Knowledge innovation and the use of Big Data and analytics for decision makers and entrepreneurs Role of Big Data and analytics in leveraging intuition, judgement, and wisdom in organizations and society Socio-technical theories and application in the Big Data era Data-driven decision-making and the role of human input  Analysis of web and social media Big Data including text mining, sentiment analysis, and emotion analysis for decision making  Mitigating the effects of misinformation and disinformation in data acquisition and analysis Knowledge management (KM), Big Data and analytics for formulating business strategy and government policy Design, development, and use of KM and analytics technologies to support data-driven decisions, judgements, and strategies Organizational barriers and enablers of the use of technology for KM and business analytics in managerial and strategic decision- and policy-making Data visualization as knowledge tool for decision-making Real time analysis of knowledge including wisdom of the crowds-based research Data-knowledge transformation for operational, managerial and strategic decision-making Business analytics and Big Data challenges in managing data-driven operational, managerial, and strategic decision-making Data Mining of tacit and explicit knowledge  Organizational culture and data-driven organizations Issues concerning ethics, legality and security of data in judgement and decision making Individual, Intra-, and inter-organizational KM and business analytics technologies Using multi-source heterogenous data for decision making  Datamining-based recommendation systems and their use in decision making  Contact information of mini-track chairs  Prof David J Pauleen (Primary Contact Person) Professor of Technology Management,  School of Management, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand +64 213 6385   Dr Kasuni Weerasinghe Lecturer Management Information Systems School of Management, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand +64 213 6379   Dr Nazım Taşkın Assistant Professor Information Systems Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey +90 212 359 6940    Dr Shafiq Alam Senior Lecturer  School of Management, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand +642102551682    All track chairs are members of the  at Massey University.

This influx of edtech tools are changing classrooms in a variety of ways: AI based edtech robots, machine learning based classroom models, usage of conversational AI based chatbots, are making it easy for students to stay engaged through fun forms of learning; IoT devices, that are not only providing resources over a variety of platforms, but are encouraging an ecosystem driven by the need of connectivity,  are being hailed for their ability to create digital classrooms for students, whether they’re physically in school, on the bus or at home; even machine learning and blockchain tools are assisting teachers with grading tests and holding students accountable for homework.  The potential for scaleable individualized learning goes beyond a classroom and has ushered an integrated environment that is seamless. It has played an important role in edtech's ascendance. The way we learn, how we interact with classmates and teachers, and our overall enthusiasm for the same subjects is not a one-size-fits-all situation. Everyone learns at their own pace and in their own style. Edtech tools make it easier for teachers to create individualized lesson plans and learning experiences that foster a sense of inclusivity and boost the learning capabilities of all students, no matter their age or learning abilities.  In a recent survey conducted by Builtin, 92% of teachers believe tech is going to have a major impact on the way they educate in the near future. For that reason, it’s vital to understand the benefits edtech brings in the form of increased communication, collaboration and overall quality of education.  Another important aspect that this minitrack wants to encourage is that of Societal Impact. AACSB, as per their 2020 standards, explicitly mention societal impact through their new standards, where they encapsulate strategic management, curriculum, and research. As an entity that outlines standards for business and academia, AACSB’s role can be seen as an integrator that brings business and academia together to foster long term success through strategic partnerships that help unite businesses and educators. This minitrack is developed to address and serve the purpose of –   Connecting people – Businesses, communities, government and entities who can use advancement in frameworks of education to cultivate a change for a better future. Solving problems – Some of the major problems that requires methods to share knowledge and give a platform to the audience to be able to equip themselves with the right education. The minitrack helps bring partners that can find creative solutions, with the help of education, provisioned in the right possible ways.  Developing champions – The minitrack aims to find methods to develop the champions and leaders that shall tackle the best problems. The results should not only solve the problems we face, but also inspire others to seek educational ways to resort to solutions.  Creating Institutions/Entities – the societal impact we seek cannot be created using temporary solutions. We need to cultivate them over a period of time and help stay relevant to the needs to the society. These long terms entities shall provide the resources and leadership to have a purpose driven  solution to our problems. This minitrack shall help bring those ideas and frameworks together that can create a lasting impact. The value that we seek in our societies cannot be created on a one-way street. In fact the value that we seek cannot be created, but co-created. Edtech has the power of unifying these different elements in the society to create those long term and meaningful solutions through the use of technology. ‘Education beyond borders’, ‘Education for All’ are some schools of thought that have limitless benefits and the advancements in edtech can help us explore creative ways to make it a possibility. At the end of the day, the number one goal of education is to be that positive influence that helps brings solutions together. In the world of technology, edtech is that vehicle to make this happen.   This minitrack welcomes papers in all formats including empirical studies, design, theory, theoretical framework, case studies, and etc. The minitrack encourages submission of any studies from an implementation standpoint of a technical or economical model, which engages emerging technologies in the area of edtech.  The submissions include, but are not limited to, the following topics:  Theories used in edtech Virtual and distributed edtech models and technologies  Management of frameworks used in edtech Knowledge networks and the future of edtech Edtech implementation methodologies Human networks in Edtech Quality Metrics to measure the effectiveness of Edtech platforms Best practices in edtech Management and implementation frameworks and standards Automation in edtech Knowledge sharing and management in edtech using novel technologies Repurposing current methodologies into edtech Governance models in edtech Software and eservices in edtech Role of corporates/governments in edtech    Journals for fast track opportunities, if any None  Marketing plan The Call for Papers would initially be sent out via the AIS listserv. Subsequently the Minitrack chairs shall distribute the information through the channels available through their Academic institutions. We also plan to engage our industry partners who may want to engage their R&D teams working on similar projects.

Organizations that consider themselves “learning” or “knowledge- based” organizations must develop a competent workforce using organizational learning strategies. Success in  organizations involves developing a variety of human factors for these changing competencies. In addition, due  to technological change, modification and revisions, many skills require updating for a competitive advantage in  the marketplace.   Innovation in learning organizations involves all the processes of creating, transferring, modifying, and retaining  knowledge over time. These updating processes may occur at the individual, group, or organizational levels. This  minitrack is devoted to and involves topics that would benefit the essential functions of organizations that use all  types of knowledge. The focus will examine current research on organizations and the knowledge workers within  to understand the how to select, and update current knowledge as well as behavioral strategies for learning and  competency maintenance and learning in order to gain a competitive advantage.  Proposed Research Area   Learning Organizations and Knowledge Organizations need to focus strategically to develop organizational  potential. There is a gap between current learning within organizations and their ability to create, acquire, select,  transfer, and manage knowledge to remain competitive. The workers within these organizations also need to  develop themselves through the selection and acquisition of specialized skills for the work of the future. What  they  change  and  use  as  their  current  knowledge  base  creates  current  competencies.  Effective  knowledge  management strategies are needed to strengthen these organizations and will benefit from well-directed research  in these areas.   This mini track highlights examining the role of knowledge in organizations and individuals. How it is decided to  change, update, use, or disregard knowledge elements and how it is determined to intentionally suppress existing  knowledge is of interest. This mini-track therefore, expresses diversity of organizational learning methods within  a Knowledge Management framework. It seeks to explore different ways in which organizational knowledge base  is created, used, and modified. The lens to view organizations may be diverse; organizations using socio-technical  systems, where the term knowledge base could broadly refer to individual or organizational knowledge (i.e.,  organizational and individual goals, norms, and processes) or refer to machine knowledge (i.e., information  systems, data stores, and analytics) that can be applied or put into action.   Several factors that affect the success of knowledge base change within knowledge and learning organizations  will  be  limited  to  research  in  the  following  areas:  organizational  cultural  considerations  in  knowledge  management, trust factors and human social interactions, communication strategies to promote knowledge  acquisition and learning, knowledge transfer, knowledge selection, updating processes, and change methods  within organizations. In addition, submissions dedicated to knowledge and learning organizations focused on  leadership processes will be accepted. Interdisciplinary contributions connecting related research streams using  innovation,  learning,  unlearning,  and  intentional  forgetting  of  knowledge  (i.e.,  information  systems  and  psychology) are welcome within the IO  minitrack. Fast track to journal publication is encouraged and  discovery will be available at the HICSS author meeting (for example, IJKM or others as indicated by the  subject matter presented).

Compiling a list of University Departments where Organizational Behavior is taught  9.  Compiling a list of University Departments of business and management   10.  Posting the CFP’s at various locations through email  11.  Using personal invitation from the Minitrack Chair using lists as described above   12.  Sending the CFP to interested colleagues and previous paper authors  13.  Contacting Learning Organizations for research opportunities that may be published at HICSS   14.  Reviewing previous HICSS authors to invite them to submit to this new mini-track   15.  Consider preparing a u-tube and other social media campaign to stir interest  16.  Brainstorming with other Mini-Track Chairs to see what has been effective for them    The Chairs believe that speed of implementation is needed again this year and will encourage reduction of fear  re: COVID -19 and promote the real possibility of an on- ground conference this again this year with consistent  marketing to all scholars.     It is the goal of the Chairs to begin marketing as soon as the proposal is approved and remind submitters that  conference participants can enjoy a safe experience. Conference Providers will need to send this information to  all Chairs and Mini-track Chairs for their use in marketing. CfPs need to be sent out to all contacts, scholars and  universities, followed up by personal invitations and other announcements. This should extend our outreach and  increase number of submissions.      Minitrack Chair:   Julee H.

On the one hand, new and emerging topics such as Responsible Knowledge Management, Spiritual Knowledge Management or KM in Purpose-driven Organizations are gaining traction in research and practice. On the other hand, the ever increasing computational capacities and features of digital technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence, are changing how we collaborate, communicate and connect, pathing the way for powerful modern Knowledge Management Systems. What do all these changes mean for the way we understand and study knowledge and KM? This minitrack is intended to bring together novel ideas to explore the future role of KM research and KM practice in a changing and increasingly dynamic world. Our overall goal is to take first steps in defining a research agenda for KM of the future. Researchers and practitioners are invited to share and present their ideas and proposals which topics KM research should address in the next decade. We welcome submissions for this minitrack adopting different theoretical lenses and worldviews, using a variety of research methods and conceptual ideas, and exploring the topic with a visionary mindset. Topics covered include (but are not limited to): What role should KM play in an increasingly connected world and how to ensure that role is realized? Novel KM research ways and approaches that contribute to insights on how people, organizations, and society in general can thrive in a changing and increasingly complex world. What role does KM play in the transformation towards sustainable business? Business Ethics and KM – what can KM contribute to doing well by doing good? How can new approaches to KM, such as Responsible KM, be concretized and translated into tools, techniques, and methods? What are epistemological alternatives to the prevailing paradigm of instrumental-calculative rationality, i.e., to the reliance on rational knowledge and thinking? KM and Organizational Spirituality – what is their link? What is the role of practical wisdom (i.e., phronesis) in managing organizations? How can the realization of an organization's purpose and KM be connected? How can KM support topics such as Organizational Becoming or Organizational Self-Enactment? What is the role of tacit knowledge and how can the use of tacit knowledge be further improved in organizations and at the individual level? KM as an enabler for remote work KM as the foundation for Artificial Intelligence – or Artificial Intelligence as enabler for KM, or both directions? How much knowledge is in Knowledge Graphs? In what ways do new digital technologies change how people and organizations communicate and collaborate, and how does this change KM? What is the role of established KM frameworks in an increasingly digital world?  What is the role of unlearning in envisioning as well as adopting new KM practices?   This minitrack welcomes all types of contributions, both conceptual and empirical, using a variety of methods to provide new insights into the first steps of a research agenda for KM of the future.

Cooper (lynne.cooper [at] wsu.edu)   a) A short paragraph (approximately 150 words) describing the topics of your minitrack. If your proposal is accepted, we will use this description on the HICSS website.  This minitrack examines the nature and role of knowledge flows across people, organizations, places and times from technical, managerial, behavioral, organizational, and economic perspectives. As the nature of knowledge flows changes due to digitalization, consumerization of information technology (IT), and the integration of artificial agents into daily routines, it is increasingly important to understand the changes required in how knowledge workers conduct work, share knowledge and information, and learn. Knowledge management (KM) activities in organizations are no longer supported only by traditional information and communications technologies (ICTs; e.g., databases, data warehouses, information repositories, websites, email streams), but are also enabled through new forms of ICTs including artificial intelligence (AI; e.g., agents, bots, learning algorithms), social software or Web 2.0 technologies and Internet of Things (IoT). The ubiquitous and pervasive nature of these new forms of ICTs are creating flexible KM sharing environments that need to be researched more systematically.  b) Names and full mailing address, direct phone number, departmental phone number and fax, email addresses for all minitrack chairs.

Mark’s 200+ scientific publications span information systems, project management, organization studies, knowledge management and related fields. He has been Co-Chair for this proposed minitrack many times.  Mika Yasuoka is Associate Professor of Sustainable Digitalization, Department of People and Technology, Roskilde University, Denmark. Her research focuses on large scale IT system design and IT related social design. Recently she leads a project of traditional crafts knowledge management and its knowledge transfer, which tackles organizational knowledge management from community perspective. Mika’s overall research topics are design innovation methods, Computer Supported Intercultural Collaboration, interaction design and collective creativity.  Lynne Cooper is Scholarly Assistant Professor in the Management, Information Systems, and Entrepreneurship Department at Washington State University and an Industry faculty member of the Daniel J. Epstein Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering at the University of Southern California. She recently retired from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory after a mulit-decade career that included leading applied Artificial Intelligence research, developing scientific instruments for interplanetary research, reengineering JPL's new product development process, and leading JPL's Proposal Center. She served as Proposal Manager for the Mars Helicopter which will be the first helicopter on another planet, landing on Mars in 2021.   2) Define the proposed technical area, and discuss the topics the session will address and how they fit into a particular area of research. Include the title of the proposed minitrack. Include a marketing plan; adequate publicity is a crucial element in a successful minitrack.  Minitrack title: “Knowledge Flows, Transfer, Sharing and Exchange.” This minitrack focuses on examining the nature and role of knowledge flows (e.g., knowledge exchange, transfer and sharing) across people, communities, networks and organizations, as well as across both space and time. Technical, managerial, behavioral, organizational and economic perspectives on knowledge flows will be accepted and presented in this minitrack, and both qualitative and quantitative research methods are welcome. Potential topics that this minitrack will address include: Technical, managerial, behavioral, organizational and economic challenges and perspectives on knowledge flows The effects on knowledge flows of the consumerization of IT (CoIT); Internet of things (IoT); social media, social computing, social networks and communities, communities of practice (CoPs); information and computer technologies (ICTs); knowledge reuse; organization and economic incentive structures; artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and robotics; neuroscience, brain-computer interfaces, artificial humans and other computer-based entities Knowledge system analysis, design, test, evaluation, implementation, maintenance and redesign Harnessing, analyzing, visualizing and measuring knowledge flows for creativity, innovation, competitive advantage  Marketing will be accomplished via the Co-Chairs’ professional networks, which include successful authors published via previous HICSS events, as well as promotion via list servers and like venues. Based upon previous conferences, this approach is likely to generate considerable interest.  3) Discuss how these topics have recently been covered in other conferences and publications to substantiate that HICSS is an appropriate and timely forum for the topics.  Most practitioners and researchers recognize that knowledge flows are extremely important, especially in the current age where organizations have to continually learn and innovate to remain competitive. Given that knowledge flow is seen as an essential source of a firm’s sustainable competitive advantage, it is imperative to understand and manage this process in an effective manner. This minitrack was first approved and successfully implemented in HICSS 2003. We continue to have excellent attendance in this minitrack, and the sessions continue to generate much thoughtful discussion. The Editors (e.g., EICs, SEs, AEs) of prominent knowledge management and IS journals (e.g., Information Systems Journal, Communications of the AIS, International Journal of Knowledge Management, Knowledge Management Research & Practice) are looking in part to this minitrack for papers that can be published in the journals.  4) An explicit statement that your organization endorses your involvement and will pay for your travel and registration cost to attend HICSS. Please be aware of funding application deadlines. At least one minitrack chair is required to attend the conference.  All three of us attended the conference in 2020, and we all are expecting to attend in 2023."

Organizations that consider themselves “learning” or “knowledge- based” organizations must develop a competent workforce using organizational learning strategies. Success in  organizations involves developing a variety of human factors for these changing competencies. In addition, due  to technological change, modification and revisions, many skills require updating for a competitive advantage in  the marketplace.   Innovation in learning organizations involves all the processes of creating, transferring, modifying, and retaining  knowledge over time. These updating processes may occur at the individual, group, or organizational levels. This  minitrack is devoted to and involves topics that would benefit the essential functions of organizations that use all  types of knowledge. The focus will examine current research on organizations and the knowledge workers within  to understand the how to select, and update current knowledge as well as behavioral strategies for learning and  competency maintenance and learning in order to gain a competitive advantage.  Proposed Research Area   Learning Organizations and Knowledge Organizations need to focus strategically to develop organizational  potential. There is a gap between current learning within organizations and their ability to create, acquire, select,  transfer, and manage knowledge to remain competitive. The workers within these organizations also need to  develop themselves through the selection and acquisition of specialized skills for the work of the future. What  they  change  and  use  as  their  current  knowledge  base  creates  current  competencies.  Effective  knowledge  management strategies are needed to strengthen these organizations and will benefit from well-directed research  in these areas.   This mini track highlights examining the role of knowledge in organizations and individuals. How it is decided to  change, update, use, or disregard knowledge elements and how it is determined to intentionally suppress existing  knowledge is of interest. This mini-track therefore, expresses diversity of organizational learning methods within  a Knowledge Management framework. It seeks to explore different ways in which organizational knowledge base  is created, used, and modified. The lens to view organizations may be diverse; organizations using socio-technical  systems, where the term knowledge base could broadly refer to individual or organizational knowledge (i.e.,  organizational and individual goals, norms, and processes) or refer to machine knowledge (i.e., information  systems, data stores, and analytics) that can be applied or put into action.   Several factors that affect the success of knowledge base change within knowledge and learning organizations  will  be  limited  to  research  in  the  following  areas:  organizational  cultural  considerations  in  knowledge  management, trust factors and human social interactions, communication strategies to promote knowledge  acquisition and learning, knowledge transfer, knowledge selection, updating processes, and change methods  within organizations. In addition, submissions dedicated to knowledge and learning organizations focused on  leadership processes will be accepted. Interdisciplinary contributions connecting related research streams using  innovation,  learning,  unlearning,  and  intentional  forgetting  of  knowledge  (i.e.,  information  systems  and  psychology) are welcome within the IO  minitrack. Fast track to journal publication is encouraged and  discovery will be available at the HICSS author meeting (for example, IJKM or others as indicated by the  subject matter presented).   Contributions from this minitrack of Organizational Learning may include, but are not limited the following  topics:     1.   Organizational learning:   1.1. Individual, group and organizational learning processes  1.2. Knowledge creation, acquisition, transfer, change and forgetting  1.3. Organizational memory and knowledge base  1.4.

There are  many questions that remain unanswered. What is the role of knowledge management in practice? How do  current theories regarding knowledge management and organizational learning contribute to real-world  applications? How can we facilitate best practices in knowledge use? While numerous journals focus  exclusively on these topics, and several information systems-oriented conferences feature KM and OL- specific tracks, theory is at risk of being separated from functional practice and administration. Although  not specifically documented in the literature, there is a gap between knowledge systems research currently  being conducted with the operational, results-driven practical experiences detailing needs of knowledge  workers. We should be aware and allow a new focus on the active practitioner of knowledge workers who  develop, implement, manage, and use knowledge management systems. Likewise, there are countless  practical perspectives on how to initiate, coordinate, and monitor organizational learning processes that  need to be explored and recorded.      The goal of this minitrack is to provide this “bridge” between the academic and theoretical knowledge  management; the learning scholars that develop theory and the systems practitioner community that actually  uses this knowledge on a daily basis. Fast track to journal publication is encouraged and discovery will be  available at the HICSS author meeting (for example, IJKM or others as indicated by the subject matter  presented).       This mini-track encourages two directions of knowledge exchange. On the one hand, it addresses the  question of how theory informs and impacts practice. On the other hand, it sheds light on how practice can  influence theory. Methods can include – but are not limited to- case study and action research.     Possible contributions regarding reports from the field in knowledge management may include, but are not  limited to the following:     1.  Best practices in using technology, processes, or personnel to promote:  1.1. Knowledge creation  1.2. Knowledge maintenance  1.3. Storage of knowledge  1.4. Retrieving knowledge  1.5. A willingness to contribute to a knowledge repository  1.6. A willingness to seek knowledge from a knowledge repository  1.7. Learning and unlearning processes in organizations  1.8. Communities of Practice    2.  Specific challenges encountered in knowledge management that either:   2.1.  Have  been  successfully  been  overcome  in  designing,  implementing  or  using  a  knowledge  management system  2.2.  Those challenges that have defied resolution    3.  Knowledge Management and strategic planning:  3.1. Strategic planning of knowledge management processes  3.2. Vision development and KM; theoretical and practical foundations of knowledge-based vision and  strategy development  3.3. KM, strategy and organizational routines    4.  Other challenges to the research community      All types of papers are welcomed and we consider this minitrack focusing on a variety of issues including  the “softer side” of Knowledge Management (KM). This perspective is not often addressed, but can make  substantial contributions of great interest to the practioner and the scholar alike. Drawing from diverse and  interdisciplinary fields are appropriate for focused studies in this minitrack, and are not limited to, an  application of current theory, the perspective and application of the practitioner or the KM scholar. We  invite both industry and the research community to participate in this minitrack. Traditional scholarly  requirements are modified and all methodologies meeting the criteria and will be considered.     The Co-Chairs are both committed to scholarly endeavors of both industry and faculty.

Therefore, a high maturity level of KM research has been achieved. However, organizational knowledge/KM initiatives are more and more faced with budget cuts and justification demands due to intense competition in today’s business environments. The influences of the rapid pace of globalization and of the ongoing liberalization of national and international markets lead to the emergence of increased pressure on existing companies. Project managers of knowledge/KM initiatives like Chief Knowledge Officers need to justify their budgets and, thus, are in need of qualitative and quantitative evidence of the initiatives’ success. In addition, ROI calculations and traditional accounting approaches do not tell an adequate story when proposing knowledge-based initiatives. This minitrack explores research into strategies, methodologies, and stories that relate to measuring this success. In addition, this minitrack will be used to explore the bodies of performance measurements that define the current state of research in measuring knowledge system, KM, organizational memory, and organizational learning success. Eventually, another purpose of this minitrack is to present research on how to value knowledge-based initiatives.  Possible Paper Topics: Frameworks and models for assessing knowledge systems, knowledge management, and/or organizational memory systems Methodologies and processes for measuring knowledge systems, knowledge management and/or organizational memory success and performance Impact of knowledge use, knowledge management strategy, organization, systems, culture, and other issues on knowledge management/organizational memory success Organizational effectiveness/efficiency due to knowledge management/organizational memory/organizational learning, knowledge and organizational memory use Knowledge systems, knowledge management, organizational memory, and organizational learning metrics Knowledge systems, knowledge management, organizational memory, and organizational learning success factors and key performance indicators Benchmarking of knowledge systems/knowledge management/organizational memory initiatives Case studies of knowledge systems, knowledge management and organizational memory success and performance measurements Measuring knowledge systems, knowledge management and/or organizational memory performance in global organizations and globally dispersed communities Effectiveness and/or efficiency of knowledge systems/knowledge management/organizational memory systems and/or innovation, entrepreneurship and crowd systems Modeling and measuring the impact of social software on knowledge system/knowledge management performance Measuring the effects and value of AI and AR implementations in/for organizations Measuring the role and impact of diversity in knowledge systems/knowledge management/organizational memory systems Defining knowledge systems, knowledge management and organizational memory success Rigorous anecdotes and user stories and their theoretical basis to facilitate the value of knowledge-based initiatives Developing grounded theory approaches to valuing knowledge-based initiatives Understanding knowledge-based initiatives’ activities and output as service offerings and exploring their productivity Usage, adoption and success of knowledge management methods  Coverage in other Conferences: Knowledge management is a very popular IS research topic, and has received attention at most academic conferences in Information Systems. However, this minitrack is unique in the sense that it strives to investigate value, performance and success measurements of knowledge systems, knowledge management, organizational memory, and respective systems. Additionally, the 28-years history of the original KM/OM Implementation and other Issues minitrack at HICSS makes it one of the oldest and most established outlets for scholars and academics working in these areas.  3. Continuation of a current research area: This minitrack represents a continuation of the topics addressed in knowledge systems, knowledge management, organizational memory, and organizational learning in past HICSS conferences. The popularity of this topic has been proved by the high number of paper submissions, high quality presentations, high attendance numbers, and sustained interest in the area. We expect the minitrack will continue the evolution of knowledge systems, knowledge management, organizational memory, and organizational learning discipline.

Examples  can  be  found  across  areas  such  as  management  decision  making,  manufacturing, and even design and creative applications (e.g., Ambach and Repenning 1996;  Kittur et al. 2019). These tools use data science techniques to generate predictive insights, some  of which can be described as rational agents that perform tasks in an autonomous fashion, i.e.,  with little or no user intervention. AI methods are guided by their underlying machine learning  models and associated functions. They constitute a new type of material agency in the context  of contemporary organizing.     But as organizations become more reliant on AI methods, they need new management theories,  frameworks, and methodologies that can help them understand the consequences of using these  AI tools—both at the level of structures and organizational practices. Such agents often rely on  complex internal processing, their behavior is less predictable than that of the types of IT  artifacts we are used to dealing with (Xiao and Benbasat 2007). This opens up a number of  problem areas with regards to managing and organizing these methods (Puranam et al. 2014).  For example:   •  How does coordination shift as AI tools are used, and what new types of organizational  hierarchies and structures emerge?   •  How do power relations change, and how do different organizational actors use these  new technologies to reshape power relations?   •  What is the impact of using AI on those processes that have traditionally been seen as  being entirely driven and controlled by humans?  •  How can the organization evaluate the ethical implications of deployed AI methods?  •  What are relevant KPIs and metrics for assessing the effectiveness of AI applications?  •  How should an organization manage, staff and coordinate AI development teams?    This mini-track aims to contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms through which  humans organize together with AI-based systems as well as the process organizations use to  develop these AI methods and systems.    We aim to provide a platform for thought and discussion in this important and emergent field  within  information  systems  and  IT  research.  We  invite  conceptual  as  well  as  empirical  contributions using different methodological approaches (qualitative, quantitative, design- oriented, simulation, etc.).    In addition to the questions raised above, potential topics include, but are not limited to:   •  AI & coordination: How does AI change the way humans coordinate?  •  AI & crypto: How can smart contracts and DAOs create new organizational forms?  •  AI & power: How does AI affect corporations, markets, and peer production structures?  •  AI & governance: Who runs the technology? What does the technology run?  •  AI & development: How to manage AI project and deployment risk?  •  AI & creativity: How can AI be creative? How can humans and AI be co-creators?  •  AI & design: What does AI design? Should it design itself?  •  AI & innovation: How does AI foster innovation?  •  AI & news work: How does AI change news and civic engagement?  •  AI & crowds: What do crowds do for machine learning, and what’s in it for the crowds?  •  AI & organizational routines: How does AI change the nature of work?

Digitalization has  already changed the ways in which we create, produce, and distribute knowledge. AI has been predicted  to change occupations and skill demand. Educators and policymakers are looking for new ways to re- design education and learning for the AI-age. Many countries have positioned AI as a strategic area of  development in the education sector, and the OECD, UNESCO, the World Economic Forum, and the  European Union have developed or are in the process of developing guidelines for AI use in education.  Much extant work on AI in education (AIEd) has focused on improving instruction by personalizing  content delivery. Often the underpinning assumption has been that AI technologies can automate key  teacher tasks, including assessment, monitoring of student progress, and pacing of content delivery.  AI may automate existing teaching and administrative practices in schools and universities, but it can  also support new models of learning and address emerging social needs for education. Education is  deeply rooted in culture, economy, and mechanisms of social and institutional reproduction. As we  move beyond the industrial age and educational models optimized for the past social and economic  needs, the potential of AI in education should be viewed in this evolving context.  In this minitrack, we explore the transformation of education both from technical and social points of  view. On technical side, we look for innovative applications of AI in education with transformative  potential that show how education and learning could happen in the future. These are bridges from the  present towards the future. From the social side, we look for empirical and conceptual contributions  that explore the emerging futures and their requirements for AI in education and learning.  Bridges are built using technology, but they break without adequate support. We are specifically  interested in three mediating factors between technology and social development: policy, regulation,  and ethics. In the educational sector, these form complex fields that shape the development and  realization of technologies and technology-mediated practices. The following key questions, therefore,  provide the overall framing for the minitrack:    How AIEd enables new pedagogic and organizational models that address emerging needs for  education and learning?    What are the key emerging social requirements for education that could be addressed with  state-of-the-art AIEd?    How does policy, regulation, and ethics of AI in education shape the paths from the present to  the future?  The minitrack calls contributions from authors who work at the crossroads of AI and learning analytics,  learning sciences, human-computer interaction, educational sociology, and technology and policy  studies.    1  Keywords: AIEd, learning analytics, future of education, future of learning, AI-enabled learning    Journals for fast track opportunities  Fast-track opportunities will be explored in the next months. The co-chairs are affiliated with several  journals in the educational technology and policy area.

As a result of rapid digital transformation and unprecedented changes caused by recent global pandemic, organizations are now facing various challenges, covering the whole life cycle of BI/BA/big data applications and projects. Emerging trends such as the Internet of Things (IoT), augmented analytics powered by machine learning and AI and DataOps, which are enhancing the entire analytics life cycle, are all urging companies to identify new use cases, applications and business models to take advantage of (big) data, analytics and AI. At the same time, companies are experiencing an unprecedented shortage in skills and analytical capabilities, which in turn limit their potential.  To close the gap between potential and real benefits of BI/BA/big data, more research on their deployment is needed in terms of artifacts such as methods, reference architectures, etc. as well as theoretical and conceptual underpinnings. Finally, operations and continuous enhancement of BI/BA/big data applications encompass management tasks that consider strategic, economic, legal and ethical issues.   Meanwhile, there is an ongoing major shift in the industry of organizations leveraging pervasive, self-service analytics. The push for self-service analytics that include a portfolio of analysis tools, algorithms and visualizations has enabled agile decision making through effective sense-making and business insights. In addition, the growth in this space has led to societal implications, both positive and harmful.  The evolution and innovation experienced has created a state of excitement and flux in the BI, BA and big data space.   Starting from a rich historic advancement in decision support systems, to more recently big data, IoT, machine learning, algorithmic decision-making and cognitive analytics, this space continues to present a wide variety of research questions and challenges for researchers to explore.   This minitrack is the longest running HICSS minitrack related to business intelligence, business analytics and more recently big data that continues to rise in relevance to both academia and practice. Its main focus remains on the organizational issues of BI/BA and big data implementations, rather than the data science and IT perspectives. This particular focus, as well as its long history of research embedded in Decision Support Systems and other research predecessors of contemporary BI/BA, creates a minitrack with a rich comprehensive view of organizational issues.  This minitrack will accept papers focused on the business and organizational aspects of business intelligence, business analytics and big data as well as challenges related to BI/BA/big data workforce including their education and ongoing professional development. Contributions from the fields of theory building, design research (methods and models), action research as well as analyses of existing or innovative applications are welcome. We invite papers that investigate topics which include, but are not limited to, the following: Innovation and Emerging Trends in Business Intelligence, Business Analytics and Big Data: Data-driven organizational resilience Data-driven business models and innovation Data ecosystems, data coops, data marketplaces and open data environments Data entrepreneurship Data humanism Data harm Societal implications of datafication and big data Innovative applications of big data and advanced business analytics  Internet of Things and edge computing in analytics Algorithmic decision-making  Cognitive analytics/Augmented analytics Cloud BI/BA Self-service BI and Analytics Data cataloguing  Impact of DataOps on the BI/BA life cycle  BI/BA and Analytics in post-pandemic world  Business Intelligence/Business Analytics/Big Data Deployment and Applications: Deployment of BI/BA/big data in different industry sectors and contexts Case studies about the successful deployment of BI/BA/big data Data lakes, multi-clouds and modern BI/BA/big data architectures and implementation frameworks Collaborative BI/BA performance management and dashboards Customer relationship management and supply chain management The role of BI/BA/big data for sustainability and circular economy Digital manufacturing and industrial analytics Smart cities and IoT Social media and BI/BA/big data Open data, big data, “small” data and warm data Data visualization strategies and visual analytics Data-driven storytelling BI/BA/big data applications that support environmental, social and governance initiatives    Management of Business Intelligence/Business Analytics/Big Data BI/BA/big data strategy, governance, and maturity models Data literacy and data-driven culture BI/BA/big data workforce: education, ongoing professional development, changing roles of the Chief Data Officer/Chief Analytics Officer, emergence of organizational citizen analytics workforce Business value and BI/BA/big data success Data monetization Business challenges of big data Big data ethics Responsible leadership of BI/BA/big data Societal impact of BI/BA/big data  Security and privacy issues BI/BA/big data challenges in NFP and non-traditional organizations (cooperatives, social enterprises)  Minitrack Relevancy This minitrack investigates the current and emerging issues in a data driven society where the use of data is seen as life blood facilitated by integrated IT infrastructure and analytics. As the significance of business intelligence, analytics and big data constantly widens, this research area should have an important place in the organizational systems track.

Blockchain, the technology underlying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, has been receiving considerable  attention in recent years, as new use cases in the public and private sector have been identified. What  started as a solution to the double-spending problem in Bitcoin, is being explored as the backbone  technology in scenarios where a trusted third party (e.g., a notary or a bank) is normally required. Using  this technology, transactions are securely registered on a data structure (aka the ledger) replicated  across a network of peers that validate the entries using a consensus mechanism. New records are  cryptographically linked to existing ones, rendering them virtually immutable. The resulting auditability  and transparency have been leveraged in proposing innovative solutions to land registries, to stop the  spread of conflict diamonds, to fight the counterfeiting of medication, to make supply chains less  opaque, and, generally, to promote new financial services.    Additionally, blockchains can also store and enforce the execution of algorithmic code know as smart  contracts – pieces of code that are executed automatically once predetermined conditions are met –  further reducing uncertainty and promoting confidence among stakeholders that would not normally  trust each other. Nevertheless, we are still in the early days of blockchain adoption, compared by some  to the introduction of the World Wide Web itself. Then, as now, few if any could predict the full extent  of the disruptive innovations that would emerge fostered by this emerging technology.    For these reasons, it is important for academics to systematically research this field, at various levels.  Conferences play a key role in disseminating knowledge about Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT -  including blockchains) due to the speed at which developments occur. The proposed minitrack had a  considerable  attendance  in  the  past  three  editions,  with  the  audience  also  registering  to  get  information on new editions or other related developments.      Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  •  Innovative uses of Blockchain technology  •  Blockchain case studies, applications, and implementations  1    •  Blockchain and privacy, security, and identity  •  Blockchain and digital transformation  •  Decentralized Finance (DeFi)  •  Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)  •  Decentralized Applications  •  Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)  •  Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)  •  Tokenization  •  The social and organizational impact of blockchain  •  Barriers and enablers in blockchain adoption  •  Blockchain and business model innovation  •  Regulatory frameworks for Blockchain  •  Governance and Blockchain  •  Verticals using Blockchain (financial, healthcare, energy, transportation, others)  •  Blockchain in e-government and public administration  •  Blockchain and the Internet-of-Things  •  Blockchain in education  •  Blockchain in solving migration and refugee issues  •  Blockchain-driven marketplaces  •  Uses and challenges of smart contracts  •  Technology and infrastructure issues in Blockchain  •  Blockchain and Metaverse      Marketing plan    As with all past editions, the minitrack will be promoted using various distribution lists, and by direct  contact with authors, reviewers and experts working in the area of DLTs that have collaborated with us  in HICSS and other conferences and journals.        Journals for fast track opportunities    There is a discussion with the journal of the Future Internet, to fast-track papers from our minitrack.                2    Sample Call for Papers    Call for Papers  Blockchain cases and innovations    This minitrack builds on the successful editions of HICSS-51 (2018), namely “Blockchain and Fintech”,  HICSS-52 (2019), entitled “The Transformational Impact of Blockchain”, and HICSS-53 to HICSS-55(2020- 2022), “Blockchain cases and innovations”.

However, recent advancements in the area of Process  Technology have equipped organizations with entirely new means to achieve this goal. In par- ticular Process Mining and Robotic Process Automation have opened up completely new op- portunities. Process Mining allows organizations to exploit transactional data recorded by In- formation Systems to improve business processes with respect to performance dimensions  such as efficiency, quality, or compliance. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) provides the  means to automate repetitive and routine-like work by employing so-called software robots.  By combining machine learning and predictive analytics with Process Technology, process  weaknesses, such as bottlenecks, cannot only be automatically identified, but also remedied  by automating the respective part of the process.     Given the large interest in this topic in both academia and practice, the goal of this minitrack  is to promote scientific exchange on Business Process Technology. The minitrack shall enable  researchers to present and discuss innovative approaches, techniques, methodologies, and  models to design, adopt, implement, operate, evaluate, and govern the data-driven analysis  of business processes.     At HICSS-55, we organized this minitrack for the first time and were happy to receive six rele- vant and interesting submissions from the areas of RPA, Process Mining, and Blockchain. The  resulting session of our minitrack consisted of three high-quality presentations and in-depth  discussions. We received very positive feedback from the participants, who considered our  session both inspiring and motivating. Against this background, we would be pleased to or- ganize the Business Process Technology minitrack for a second time.     The Business Process Technology minitrack invites contributions on topics including, but not  limited to:    •  Process Discovery  •  Conformance Checking and Analysis  •  Decision Mining   •  Predictive Process Analytics  •  Process Monitoring  •  Robotic Process Automation  •  Hyperautomation  •  Automated Process Analysis and Improvement  •  Adoption of Process Technology  •  Governance of Process Technology        Marketing plan    The three co-chairs all have strong networks and contacts to several relevant communities,  including Information Systems (IS), Business Process Management (BPM), and Process Mining.  We, therefore, will use these networks to advertise the minitrack and solicit relevant submis- sions. Besides approaching group members and colleagues directly, we will advertise the min- itrack via respective mailing lists from AISWorld, the BPM Association, and the IEEE Task Force  on Process Mining.

Yet, recent studies and observations have revealed worrying evidence that IT use may also be hiding potentially serious “dark sides” []. In other words, IT use may lead to a host of negative consequences with varying degrees of severity for individuals, employees, families, firms and societies []. For example, studies have shown that people spend approximately one fourth of their workday handling IT-related interruptions. To exacerbate the matter, it can take almost twenty minutes to get back to the original task after the interruption is over. Furthermore, employees’ misuse of organizational IT could account for 50-75 percent of all information security breaches []. Additional findings indicate that 43 percent of users find the use of smartphones stressful; 60 percent of users cannot go for an hour without checking their phones for messages and email; 24 percent of users check their smart phones while driving; and 54 percent check their smart phones in the middle of the night or immediately upon waking up [].  Moreover, 28 percent of employees admitted to playing while at work []. This is perhaps not surprising given that 0.7-11% of the Internet user population can be classified as “addicted” to an Internet application [], and many others present addiction-like symptoms that do not meet addiction classification criteria [, ]. Consequently, employees often engage in unplanned technology-mediated behaviors such as swearing [, ], organizational deviance [], and technology-mediated dangerous behaviors [], which can heavily harm individuals, firms and societies [].  Adding to this array of issues, concerns about artificial intelligence [] and fake news emerged in recent years []. Specifically, the rise of artificial intelligence affords many unfair and biased recommendations[] and suboptimal behaviors, such as algorithm aversion []. Concerns about social responsibility of technology giants  [] as well as possible negative effects of technologies on children [] and youth [] have also surfaced. Concerns about the ability of social media platforms to tame fake news dissemination have also been raised [].  The fact that the IS tools we develop and the process we support may underlie such negative effects, behooves us, as a research community to pay closer attention to the “dark sides” of technology use. This minitruck aims at advancing the undarning of such issue and the efficacy of solution to those issues. To this end, it welcomes theoretical and empirical papers examining negative consequences of IT use and implementation in organizations and societies, and solutions to these issues. The objective of this minitrack is to focus not only on the antecedents, development processes, and consequence of numerous phenomena related to the unexpected negative effects of IT use, but also on potential strategies and techniques for behavioral and technological interventions. We seek, based on this forum of discussion, to provide practitioners (e.g., IT developers, managers, psychologists, and policy makers) in a multitude of contexts with a deeper understanding of the potential consequences regarding the dark sides of IT use. Further, we hope these studies help to shape guidelines for designing and implementing organizational and hedonic IT while minimizing the potential negative consequences of IT use. Submitted papers might focus on, but are not limited to, some of the following themes related to potential dark sides of IT use. We acknowledge that over time new “dark side of IT” phenomena will emerge, and we are hence open to topics that may extend this list. Problematic IS use behaviors IT-related addictions, misuse and abuse Algorithmic bias, fairness and aversion Cyber loafing Cyber bullying  Dark sides of artificial intelligence and/or robots Dark sides of big data Dark sides of digital assistants and wearable devices Deceptive computer-mediated communication  Fake news Disrupted work-life balance IT interruptions  Technostress Impulsive use of IT Adverse physiological effects of IT use  Submissions are welcome and encouraged from a variety of theoretical foundations (e.g., information systems, psychology, cognitive science, decision sciences, sociology, social networks, organizational behavior, neuroscience, computer science, and informatics) which might advance our knowledge of the antecedents, processes, interventions and consequences of the dark sides of IT use. The track invites relevant and rigorous studies without restriction for the methodologies used, units of analyses and levels of theorization.

DA often refers to information  technology (IT) and processes that support reporting, statistical analyses, and data mining. The use  of DA applications can help both internal (e.g., top management team) and external (e.g., investors,  practitioners, policymakers, etc.) to sense changes in the market, to improve their response speed  and efficacy, to reduce business risks, and to increase competitive advantages. Given the growth  in the use of DA, it has become imperative in many organizations for helping firms make better,  more informed and often faster decisions. However, not all management teams deciding to invest  in DA improve their systems because of significant risks and uncertainties in governance, economy,  and environment. Indeed, DA’s relatively show diffusion could result from a lack of evidence and  understanding about the impact of DA tools and techniques, a lack of leadership, or the complex  interactions between DA and the business environment from different stakeholders’ priorities.     In this mini-track, we seek research papers and experience reports that explore how different  stakeholders view and use DA for identifying and analyzing a firm’s risks and establishing  effective control environments. Analyzing data in a timely manner enables businesses to gain  insights from their internal and external environments and to better sense changes in their markets;  indeed, it serves as a basis for determining how risks, control effectiveness, and policy compliance  should be managed. With data surrounding us, how businesses can take advantage of the insights  generated by DA to better understand risks and uncertainties that they are facing and more  importantly, to improve their risk management and control systems are important questions.     Further, we seek to focus on some key concepts of DA and control systems, including the metrics  for DA technique selection and success, how the use of DA in start-ups can be leveraged in other  contexts, and in general, expanding the use of DA beyond organizational systems.      Possible topics for the mini-track include but are not limited to:    - The Role of Different Stakeholders in Data Analytics Management  - Data Analytics and Leadership Styles  - The Diffusion of Data Analytics in Organizations  - Using Data Analytics to Manage Business Values and Risks  - Data Analytics and Business Reporting  - Data Analytics and Performance Evaluation as KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)   - Effects of Automation on Business Outcomes and Efficiency   - Current Practices of Data Analytics in Internal Control and Risk Management    Continue a practice of marketing HICSS as a place where “systems thinkers” get  together, from a variety of fields. Attendees and speakers will benefit from exposure to  more fields (and markets for their research).       Market this session and venue as mutual respected conferences/workshops, such as  Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS), Decision Sciences Institute,  International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS), and Association for Information  Systems Special Interest Group on Accounting Information Systems (SIG ASYS), where  both accounting and information system academics and professionals can meet, discuss  and collaborate.       Solicit key influencers in data analytics practices. This will combine mailing lists from  Dr. Jee-Hae Lim, who is active in the Accounting Information Systems (AIS) academic  and professional communities, and Dr. Tu Xu, who is active in the Data Analytics  academic and training communities.       As an Editor of Journal of Information Systems (JIS), and an associated editor of  International Journal of Accounting Information Systems (IJAIS), Dr. Jee-Hae Lim will  encourage researchers to submit papers, which can be selectively considered for  publication in either JIS and IJAIS at the authors’ prerogative.

DSR is a prominent form of engaged scholarship, which combines inquiry with a potential for action and intervention.  DSR may be viewed as having three related subfields, from which we welcome submissions:  Science of design, which focuses on creating ‘new-to-the-world’ artifacts . We try to provide an outlet for researchers doing novel artifact driven research in information systems, but also in other fields such as industrial engineering or service design.  Design theory studies, which focus on the development of theories and design principles concerned with creating new or improved systems based on kernel or grand theories [4-6].  Design Research, which focuses on the study of how designers conduct design activities, e.g., science of design research. Papers in this subfield could potentially come not only from IS, but also from architecture and design studies [7-8].  All three subfields are often (but not always) tightly engaged with design practice.  Accordingly, they frequently embody participative forms of research that rest on the advice and perspectives of multiple stakeholders in understanding a complex social problem.  While specific interest is placed upon DSR and design theorizing with respect to the three subfields described above, the minitrack welcomes submissions from the entire range of alternatives that deal with the question of integrating inquiry with the potential of creating and shaping alternative futures.  Such work extends the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by theorizing and/or creating new and innovative artifacts. The building and application of these designed artifacts produces knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solutions, which is then potentially transferable to other domains. In design science, the engagement is primarily focused on the design and evaluation of an artifact; learning through building with the aim to generate theoretical insights. This is often an iterative research process and sometimes capitalizes on learning via both researcher and subject expertise within the context of the participants' social system. It can be a clinical method that puts IS researchers in an active supporting role for advanced practice. To this end we also seek implementable and grounded action frames for engaging in such generalizable inquiries.  Accordingly, the scope of this mini track includes research contributions that arise from all three subfields of DSR described above.  This includes engaged approaches, studies of the practical use of DSR approaches, the use of such approaches to expand theory, and conceptual foundations that significantly and cogently expand our understanding of the epistemology and methodology of such approaches and their philosophical underpinnings.  These include:  Developing design artifacts and design theories Evaluating and testing design artifacts and design theories Different approaches to the design of artifacts and design theorizing Design as a creative act in development for systems etc. Advancing theory and practice in designing for systems etc. Design experiences in organizational systems and technology etc. Concrete design projects and their outcomes  Bios:   Richard Baskerville is a Regents’ Professor at Georgia State University.

This innovation involves generation of digital products and services (digital innovation), and the consequent fundamental changes to organizations, organizational networks and industries (digital transformation). These innovations are often created and realized through new ventures either in startups or existing organizations (digital entrepreneurship).  The goal of this minitrack ‘Digital Innovation, Transformation, & Entrepreneurship’ is to examine the nexus between digital technologies, consequent innovation and entrepreneurial action by offering a venue for original and innovative research that focuses on digital technologies, associated innovation, and related entrepreneurial activities and forms.  The minitrack solicits three types of submissions: (1) the antecedents, processes, infrastructures, outcomes, and organizational settings associated with the generation and appropriation of novel product and service innovations enabled by digital technologies; (2) new organizing structures and processes enabled by digitalization, as well as associated novel organizational arrangements and business models, the transformation process, antecedents, and outcomes; and (3) new ventures that involve the identification and deployment of emerging, radical innovations in digital technologies such as block-chain, 5G or IoT. Next we will describe each of these types of submissions with examples of each.  (1) Digital Innovation These submissions investigate the role and functions of digital technologies within innovative products or services, and how these technologies impact consequent organizational innovation and strategy (e.g., questions of architecture, modularity, platform governance, standards and means of systems integration). Topics can include: Organizing for digitally-enabled products and services Products and services developed around novel and emerging digital technologies Digital technologies and service science Digital convergence and organizational and industrial organization Digitalization of physical products and changes in product strategies Design thinking for digital Innovating within digital service ecosystems and on platforms Digital product architectures Digitalization, product modularity, and modes of organizing Digital controls and control points and organizing Digital twin and related product capabilities Products and services enabled by emerging generic digital technologies (e.g., robots, 3D printing, sensor networks, blockchain, quantum computing, etc.) and novel digital phenomena such as mobility, social, big data, cloud computing, service architectures, virtual/augmented reality, Internet of Things. (2) Digital Transformation As organizations transition from the industrial to the digital age, they need to undergo a transformation in how they organize and control for new digital processes. Submissions that investigate the role of digital technologies in inducing and enabling organizational change, including innovative strategies, new business models, new organizing structures, processes and tasks enabled by digital technologies and their adaptation to digitally enabled forms of organizing. Topics include: Industrial vs. digital innovation regimes and related analyses of change Short and long term analyses of digital transformation and innovation waves Digitally enabled business models and strategies, Digital strategies, agility, and organizational learning Digital platform ecosystems Sociotechnical and sociomaterial conceptualizations and forms of organizational change Digital technologies and organizational design, digital business units Digital technologies and organizational routines and business processes Business process change in organizations and the role of digital technologies Digital innovation units and their role in digital transformation Digital technologies and re-configuration of value-chains Industrial organization and the impact of digital technologies Embedding digital technologies in tools and changes in work practices Organizational identity, culture and digital transformation Digital innovation platforms (such as mobile platforms, crowd-sourcing platforms, etc.) and organizing  (3) Digital Entrepreneurship   Digital innovation opens continual opportunities for entrepreneurial action. New ventures and established organizations alike are concerned with generating radical business models and solutions that leverage digital technologies. Topics exploring digital innovation and entrepreneurship, broadly conceived are welcomed including: New venturing with and by digital technologies and digital business models Entrepreneurship forms and models within organizations enabled by digital technologies Entrepreneurial launch processes with digital technologies such as agile and lean startup Structuring of organizations to generate and enable new ventures (structural, contextual ambidexterity) Incubators, accelerators, and ecological processes to launch and sustain digital ventures Finance of digital technology entrepreneurship including corporate funding, venture capital, private equity, angel investing, etc. Digital tools enabling creativity, design, engineering, and other innovative entrepreneurial activities. Infrastructures for organizational and interorganizational innovation, such as product lifecycle management (PLM) systems in manufacturing; information modeling (BIM) environments in the AEC industry; or cyberinfrastructure (or e-science) in science. Infrastructures and ecosystems of emerging generic digital technologies (e.g., robots, 3D printing, sensor networks, blockchain, etc.) and digital phenomena such as mobile, social, big data, cloud computing, Internet of Things and related entrepreneurial forms  The types of studies that we welcome in the minitrack include an explicit focus on a particular form or function of digital technology in the context of organizational innovation, transformation, and entrepreneurship. Beyond this requirement, we welcome all forms of research inquiry, including qualitative, quantitative, mixed, and conceptual papers. In particular, we prefer novel applications of: Quantitative and computationally-intensive studies including mixed methods Case studies and detailed interpretive work Design science and action research in organizational settings Ambitious, provocative, and creative conceptual or theoretical analyses of the nature and effects of digitalization    A NOTE TO TRACK CHAIRS:   Why is this minitrack appropriate for the Organizational Systems and Technology Track?  This mini-track is appropriate for the “Organizational Systems and Technology” track because we emphasize organizational innovations that are made possible by digital technologies. Continuous digital innovation is incessantly creating new processes, products/service, and infrastructures possible for organizations – this track explicitly addresses this novel interaction of organizational aspects of digital innovation.   Marketing Plan   In the years that we have been doing this track, we continue to build our community. For HICSS 2022 we had 25 submissions. We will continue with our proven practices which involve: (1) reaching out to folks who have presented papers in previous years to solicit contributions; (2) advertise on social media – particularly LinkedIN and Twitter; and (3) promote the minitrack at all AIS SIG DITE meetings to solicit contributions.

Schmidt1  Dr. Ronald Freeze2   and   Dr. Sathya Narasimhan.3    1 Washburn University, USA  2 University of Arkansas, USA  3 Google, Inc.    Overview of Technical Area:    Title of Mini-Track:    Enterprise Ecosystem: Extending and Integrating Technology Serving the Enterprise     Research Track:    Organizational Systems and Technology    Keywords:  ERP, Enterprise integration, IOS Interorganizational Information Systems    Journals for fast track opportunities:  Have established a Fast Track journal relationship with the International Journal of Accounting  Information Systems (IJAIS). We also have Fast Track journal relationship with newer journal of  Data for Good.      Partnership with Business Industry Partner:  This year this track welcomes participation of  the leading international ERP firm of SAP with the addition of co-chair, Dr. Sathya Narasimhan,  Sr. Director, New Ventures and Technologies at SAP, Inc.    Mini-Track Description:     The Enterprise Ecosystem has the integrated enterprise system as the foundation, such  corporate systems must continuously evolve and expand to serve the changing needs of the  corporate strategy and the business environment. Expanding the enterprise ecosystem is required  when  adopting  emerging  technologies  and  responding  to  changing  business  requirements.  Management of the enterprise system is being expanded, altered and complicated by digital  transformation and continual addition of new innovations. Many firms are migrating to cloud  computing or absorbing emergent technologies such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence,  supply chain automation, IoT and Blockchain. For sustainability of the organization, there is a  need to leverage ‘Big Data”. As data achieves higher volume, velocity, and variety, firms seek  value by harvesting insights from advanced data analytics. To fully leverage an innovation, it must  be integrated into business processes and operations supported within the Enterprise Ecosystem.   1    The challenge to integrate technological innovations and adapt business processes within  organizational systems continues. ERPs are continually enhanced with technology innovations. In  addition, organizations are continually investing time to link their ERP systems with supply-chain  partner  systems  in  efforts  to  streamline  and  automate  the  entire  supply-chain.  Such  inter- organizational systems typify a newer challenge of process integration across corporate and  international  boundaries.  Normative  literature  shows  that  intra-organizational  integration  is  achieved  in  cases  where  ERP  systems  are  leveraged.  However,  the  integration  of  business  processes and systems between companies is complicated and difficult. This issue is more complex  when seeking extensive automation of inter-organizational business processes, or after a merger  or acquisition.  The challenge for organizations include both internal and external integration  challenges, but also must explore the establishment of new IT infrastructure business models.  These emerging IT infrastructure innovations that impact integrated enterprise systems include:  Hyperautomation (combining topics such as Robotic Process Automation (RPA), process mining  and user behavior mining, combined with Natural Language Processing (NLP)), telemetry devices,  cloud computing, IoT, visual interfaces, do it yourself (DIY) analytics, and new formats for data  collection and storage including No-SQL databases, cube and clusters, etc.    Availability of Research on these Topics      Recent  ICIS, AMCIS,  and DSI conferences had extensive research presentations on  Enterprise systems, the expanding enterprise ecosystem and their integration with emergent  innovations.  This well-established research track has achieved its 21st year at HICSS. Current  indications are that the enterprise eco-system is transforming and expanding. This transformative  growth  is  to  extend  and  adapt  to  assimilate  many  emerging  technologies  including  Cloud  Computing,  inter-organizational  systems  (IOS),  financial  technologies  (Blockchain),  greater  automation, augmentation with ML and AI and other integration methods. Additionally, enterprise  integration has now reached into all size companies including small and medium enterprises, and  supply chain partners increasingly seek cross-organizational integration. We expect the expansion  of the enterprise eco-system and the evolving nature of integrated systems should attract additional  researchers to this broadly inclusive topic area.    Marketing plan (How we plan to solicit papers)    We  are  taking  a  multi-pronged  approach  to  marketing  this  track  including  seeking  participation from industry practitioners to collaborate with researchers. This will also include  general announcements to academic organization members, targeted contacts with current and  emerging researchers in the topic area (based on past proceedings and publications in the topic  area), sharing the call for papers at major conferences and professional events, and contacting users  of ERP-related resources at universities. Our call for papers will be shared at face to face  conferences when those are resumed (such as ICIS, AMCIS, ECIS and DSI conferences). A mini- track announcement will be shared with members of leading professional academic organization  members through use of the Association of Information Systems (AIS) listserv emailing system,  through the AAA accounting information systems section members and possibly through AIS  special  interest  groups  via  emails  and  at  conferences.  A  survey  of  recent  proceedings  and  publications in the topic area will be used to create a more targeted email list to send out the mini- track announcement. We will send communication about this track to recent authors on Enterprise  systems related integration topics. Announcements will be shared with faculty at SAP University  2    Alliance schools, and to faculty researchers who make use of enterprise systems educational  resources.        Sample Call for Papers     ----------------------  Call for Papers  Enterprise Ecosystem: Extending and Integrating Technology Serving the Enterprise     Mini-track:  HICSS 2023    The  focus  of  this  mini-track  begins  with  the  organizational  Enterprise  System  as  a  foundation for an integrated Enterprise Ecosystem which is often directly connected to suppliers  and  customers.  These  Enterprise  Systems  must  integrate  emerging  technologies  to  achieve  competitive advantage in day to day operations. Building on the data collected in ERP, data  analysis can be used to leverage Big Data and enhance evidence-based decision making. As the  technology landscape continues to change quickly, many new innovations impact Enterprise  Systems and continued research is needed. The integrated Enterprise Ecosystem is impacted and  must adapt to: cloud computing, sustainability, financial technologies, non-financial metrics, inter- organizational  integration  and  more.  Integrated  enterprise  systems  are  further  enabled  by  extensions related to the Internet of Things (IoT), new Big Data information sources such as  Geolocation/GIS data, telemetry, hi resolution media content and storing metadata. Data analytics  tools are offered by Enterprise vendors, in the cloud and in the data center – how does the  Enterprise ecosystem need to evolve to support and enhance the ability to perform analytics?  Heavily integrating the supply chain demands other extensions to processes, business  transactions, and data privacy/security to provide functionality to integrate with partner companies  and effectively serve customers. Linking various emerging technologies and diverse systems  together is the objective of this track on the expanded Enterprise Ecosystem.  This mini-track seeks  to explore issues, both academic and organizational, surrounding the evolution of the integrated  enterprise system – All manner of themes related to internal and external integration of Enterprise  Systems.  This  spans  topics  from  management,  organizational,  social,  project  and  process  management, supply chain, and absorbing a wide range of emerging technologies into the core  ERP systems. Investigation is needed to support the rapid change of enterprise business operations,  automation, and integration with business partners.      Papers accepted for presentation at HICSS in this OS: Enterprise Ecosystem minitrack  with an accounting component will be considered by track chairs for fasttrack submission  to the International Journal of Accounting Information Systems (IJAIS).  Papers with an  emphasis on use of data and data analysis related to international or societal initiatives that  are aligned with any one of the United Nations published goals will be referred to the  journal Data for Good.    A broad set of research topics and questions address the expanded and integrated enterprise eco- system. Some topics are listed here, but a wider range of other topics will be considered with  respect to the integrated Enterprise Ecosystem.  3      ●  New approaches to data, collection, storage and organization: No-SQL databases, cube and  clusters, columnar databases, etc.  ●  Emerging innovations that impact integrated enterprise systems include: telemetry devices,  IoT, Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Business Process Mining, User Behavior Mining…  ●  Visual interfaces, do it yourself (DIY) interfaces, integrated online analytics, ML and AI  ●  Cloud Computing-based Enterprise systems, adoption, costs, issues and benefits: Internet of  Things (IoT), Tracking, Telemetry, etc.  linked to Enterprise Systems   Inter-organizational enterprise systems (IOS) linking business processes, SCM, VMI, B2B,  B2C, etc.  ●  Analytics in support of decision-making, ML and AI  ●  Blockchain financial (FinTech), smart contract and trust services integrated with ERP   ●  Distributed autonomous organizations (DAO)  ●  Business management, project management, adoption and assimilation of ERP   ●  Transformation of enterprise ecosystem, switching vendors or moving to Cloud-based ERP.  ●  Innovations, extensions and maturing of ERP features   ●  Business Process Modeling (BPM) and process management innovation in the Enterprise  ecosystem   ●  Extending ERP systems beyond the internal business processes?

The track chairs conﬁrmed the possibility with the Editor-in-Chief of AIS- TES.   Mini-Track Description:  Information Systems (IS) can be studied and designed on diﬀerent levels. While individual and  team/workgroup level IS use and design are classics of the IS discipline, enterprise-level IS had  been investigated less frequently. Notable exceptions are Enterprise Systems (ES) and  enterprise-level IS management approaches such as Enterprise Architecture Management  (EAM) or IS Governance.   ES (such as ERP, CRM and the like) have long played an important role as operational  backbone of most organizations with the increasing complexity of today’s business  relationships, the management of backstage integration as well as a ﬂexible way of  decoupling between backstage and frontstage ES are gaining importance.   Beyond studying and designing ES, IS research covers enterprise-wide concerns also in ﬁelds  such as EAM, enterprise modelling, organizational design, or is governance. The synergies  between ES studies and these IS research ﬁelds have been under-researched as they are  traditionally have been treated separately.   The workshop aims not only to discuss the future role of ES and other enterprise-wide IS  research ﬁelds, but also explore synergy potentials and conceptual diﬀerences.  • Topics of interest include but are not limited to:  • Design and Management of Enterprise-wide Systems   • Reference Models for Enterprise-wide Systems and Processes  • Industry-speciﬁc adoption of Enterprise-wide systems  • Approaches for Enterprise Application Integration  • Enterprise Architecture Management  • Enterprise-wide and cross-enterprise coordination (e.g., design principles, data standards,  governance in digital platform-based business networks)  • Interoperability of Enterprise-wide systems with the ﬁrm and along the supply-chain  • The role of Enterprise-wide systems to support decisions (Data-driven decisions)  • Decision Support for managerial decision-making on Enterprise-wide systems (e.g., Cloud  vs. On-Premises vs. Hybrid)  Page 1 • Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Enterprise-wide systems (Sales, Procurement,  Logistics, Financial Accounting, Master Data Management)  • Enterprise-wide Systems as Platforms: Openness of systems, new level of modularity of  Enterprise-wide systems (Extensions)  • Processes and Workﬂows in Enterprise-wide systems (Workﬂow Management Systems as  part of Enterprise-wide systems)  • Database Approaches in Enterprise-wide systems  Submissions may include, but are not limited to research papers (conceptual, theoretical, and  empirical studies), as well as case studies, and best practices with managerial guidance. Both  explanatory/descriptive and design research studies are invited.  Papers accepted for presentation at HICSS in the minitrack with the potential to shape  the future role of enterprise systems will be considered for fast-track submission to the  AIS Transaction on Enterprise Systems journal.  Marketing plan:  This minitrack plans to perform new outreach to diverse areas to promote the updated  through:   1. Reach potentially interested researcher through newsletter and lists (AIS World; WI- request and the like)  2. Prepare CFP ﬂyers to attract contributions from research and practice-related  research  3. Besides the AIS-TES fast track opportunity, we will search for additional outlets  4. Reach out to thematic networks on enterprise systems of diﬀerent types  5. Preparing a list of university departments where aspects of enterprise systems are  researched and taught  6. Preparing a list of university departments of business and management   7. Posting the CFP at various locations through email  8. Using personal invitation from the minitrack chairs using lists as described above  9. Sending the CFP to colleagues  10. Presenting the CFP on the journal homepage of AIS-TES with special information on  fast track publishing opportunities  11. Preparation of a social media campaign to attract researcher and practitioner (as the  topic and mini-track is relevant for both)  It is the goal of the Chairs to start with the marketing plan once the proposal is  approved. While special circumstances may arise from the COVID-19 situation, the  minitrack chairs will closely follow the related guidelines of the HICSS conference team.  Both minitrack chairs are looking forward to manage minitrack related aﬀairs on-site.  Page 2 Name, aﬃliation, and contact information of minitrack chair (primary contact) and co- chair(s).

The pervasive use of technology has created a critical dependency that calls for a specific focus on its governance, which can be referred to as Enterprise Governance of IT. Enterprise governance of IT “(…) involves the definition and implementation of processes, structures and relational mechanisms that enable both business and IT stakeholders to execute their responsibilities in support of business/IT alignment, and the creation and protection of IT business value” (De Haes, Van Grembergen, Joshi, & Huygh, 2020, p. 3).   The mini-track “IT governance and its mechanisms” is soliciting conceptual and empirical research papers on IT governance, and the governance of other IT-related and digital artifacts (e.g., data/information governance, data analytics governance, information security governance, digital platform governance, AI governance etc.); business/IT alignment (e.g., IT strategy, digital business strategy, digital transformation strategy); and digital transformation issues from the perspective of the board and executive management (e.g., organizational culture, organizational structure, leadership, roles and responsibilities, aligning business strategy etc.)   Short mintrack description  To be innovative and competitive in today’s global digital economy, organizations have little choice but to invest in IT and digital technology. However, without the proper organizational capabilities and skills to put these digital assets to effective use, organizations are at significant risk of wasting their investments and missing key opportunities for growth and competitiveness.  Against this context, the “IT governance and its mechanisms” research mini-track focuses on the design and implementation of organizational capabilities and leadership skills required to be successful in digital transformation journeys.   Since 2001, we are chairing this “IT Governance and its mechanisms” mini-track at HICSS, in order to advance research and practice in this important area. Already with a tradition of over 20 years, the research track focuses on the organizational challenges of governing and managing digital assets and strategy.

Marketing plan Last year, we observed a noticeable decline in the number of submissions received at our mini-track. While the number of submissions used to hover around 20, we received just under 10 submissions last year. While this may be a one-time occurrence, we have thought about ways to keep the interest in our mini-track at least at previous levels, and preferably higher. In response, we have updated our topic list and mini-track description, to add a more contemporary flavor to it. We will also take a more proactive approach as to marketing the mini-track, by sharing the call for papers on our professional social media, and including a link to the call in our e-mail signatures. Our objective is to increase the number of potential submissions, by not only relying on word-of-mouth, and our reputation of a mini-track that has been running already for over 20 years. Of course, we will closely monitor this issue in the future, and take additional steps if needed.   Statement  The University of Antwerp, and the Antwerp Management School, endorse our participation and attendance at HICSS and have the infrastructure to financially support that involvement.

The minitrack follows seven years of successful exploration of platforms and ecosystems since HICSS-49 (see Russell et al. 2021). It is well understood that, in order to compete and survive, organizations have to consider ecosystem-centric perspectives. Platforms play a central role in the rapid emergence of this type of organization and the proliferation of digital technologies (Gawer 2021, de Reuver et al. 2018, van Dijck 2018). Today, platform providers like Amazon, Meta, or Apple have become dominant actors in their own industry, but also influence dynamics in complementary markets (e.g., Cusumano et al. 2019). Their influence on industries and society has changed over time and so has policy makers’ attention (Khan et al. 2019) on these actors. Although understanding the value and importance of platforms and ecosystems across various industries and domains has grown significantly over the years, there is still a paucity of research examining the dynamic and evolutionary aspects when it comes to the impact of them. We invite authors to submit their research on the impact of actors on their ecosystem and beyond, and urge them to clearly identify the actor level, e.g., individual managers, teams, firms. Building on previous years’ experience, we seek contributions that focus on the “dynamic” aspects of platforms and ecosystems, in their organization, participation and impacts. For the minitrack call, we encourage topics of interest associated with such inquiries and beyond: ● How do actors transform organizations and societies with platforms and ecosystems, and what are the (un)intended consequences? ● How do actors manage the dynamics of platform and ecosystem emergence, and what are the mechanisms driving their evolution? ● How do actors intervene to adapt platforms and ecosystems to changes in the technological, social, economic, ecologic, or political environment? ● How can ecosystem actors – from complementors to individual users – succeed within these dynamics and manage their consequences? ● How are taxonomies, vocabularies and ontologies used to describe platforms and ecosystems changing? ● How can new data and methods - including but not limited to dynamic analytics, visualization, and decision making – assist actors in understanding the dynamics of platforms and ecosystems? ● What new roles for actors are emerging in management and orchestration roles in the platform age? ● What approaches are actors finding useful for controlling underlying mechanisms for dynamics, such as network effects, to mitigate unintended consequences? The minitrack seeks contributions that problematize or build on diverse theoretical backgrounds such as management science, information systems, computer science, decision science, system science, organizational design, policy making, and behavioral economics to continue the scholarly exploration of concepts, theories, models, and tools for managing platforms and ecosystems. We are open to a wide set of methodological approaches including empirical research, case-based research, field studies, design science, behavioral decision-making experiments, and conceptual research. We encourage collaboration between academia, industry, and policy making and welcome submissions from industry and around the world. Bibliography Cusumano, M. A., Gawer, A., & Yoffie, D. B. (2019).

Metaverse is a portmanteau consisting of “meta” (which means “beyond”), to  capture the development of a virtual world beyond the physical reality, and “verse” (which refers to a  back-formation from “universe”) to refer to a virtual utopia. Second Life, a multimedia game, was  launched in 2003 and was considered as the most important application of Metaverse (or virtual world)  at the time. Despite the great attention that Second Life attracted, Metaverse did not manage to create  a critical mass possibly due to the novelty of the technology at the time and its lack of interoperability  with other solutions.     Recently, the technological advancements in blockchain technology, the evolution of Non-Fungible  Tokens  (NFTs),  the  technological  progress  in  extended  reality  (virtual  and  augmented),  the  developments in other scientific fields like Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the convergence of all the  above technologies have increased the popularity of Metaverse. We are still in the beginning of this  new digital future and software vendors including Facebook and Microsoft have already launched their  Metaverse platforms. The fact that Facebook renamed its mother company to “Meta” shows how  important Metaverse is in Facebook’s overall strategy.     It is expected that a new generation of Internet will evolve from Metaverse, built of technologies like  extended reality, blockchain, and others. The dynamic of Metaverse is huge with many experts  predicting that it will generate a multi-trillion market in the coming years. Despite the opportunities  and the advantages that Metaverse may offer, there are many open challenges that need to be assessed  and addressed including social, legal, ethical, technical, and others.     For these reasons, it is important for academics to systematically research this field at various levels.  Conferences, with their fast turnaround, play a key role in disseminating knowledge about Metaverse  due to the speed at which developments occur. The proposed minitrack aims to bridge a gap at HICSS  and serve as a venue to share knowledge and discuss the latest developments in Metaverse.    Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  •  Open Metaverse  •  Blockchain and Metaverse  1    •  Non-Fungible Tokens and their impact on Metaverse  •  Metaverse use cases   •  Social, legal and ethical challenges of Metaverse  •  Metaverse adoption and diffusion  •  Virtual economies  •  Metaverse interoperability  •  Best Metaverse practices   •  Metaverse and disruptive innovation  •  Gaming and virtual worlds  •  Real estate in Metaverse   •  Metaverse business models   •  Extended reality applications   •  Underlying theories and concepts   •  Assessing the impact of Metaverse in human relations and behavior  •  Integrating humans, machines and AI  •  Cross platform ownership of digital goods  •  Technologies and infrastructures for virtual worlds       Marketing plan    The minitrack will be promoted using various distribution lists and by direct contact with authors,  reviewers and experts working in Metaverse and related areas (e.g., blockchain) that have collaborated  with us in HICSS and other conferences and journals.        Journals for fast track opportunities    There is a discussion with the journal “Future Internet” to fast-track papers from our minitrack.                2    Sample Call for Papers    Call for Papers  Metaverse    The term “Metaverse” was first introduced in 1992 by the science fiction writer Neal Stephenson in his  novel “Snow Crash”.

"HICSS-56","OS","Organizational Systems and Technology","b6d529de-748f-407f-beb5-5baad181703b","Practice-based IS Research"," Proposal: HICSS-56 (2023) Minitrack: Practice-based IS Research  Description  This minitrack encourages practice-based research on new and emerging IS issues in organizations. Practice-based research bridges the gap between academic theory and practice. It aspires to introduce researchers to state-of-the-art practices and issues from industry and introduce managers to research that makes sense and brings coherence to the problems they face. The methods used in practice-based research are often exploratory field-based studies involving interviews, observations, and practice data. The intense pressure to achieve methodological distinction and theoretical contribution often results in researchers’ current practice-based topics being eschewed because the topics themselves are not mature enough in practice to attain desirable samples or sample sizes, nor are they conducive to theorizing since so little is known. These are precisely the reasons that exploratory, practice-based research can play a tremendous role in helping establish and lay the foundations of a research domain while providing insights into an emerging topic.  The objective of this minitrack is to encourage practice-based research in information systems and disseminate the results of that research in a manner that makes its relevance and utility readily apparent.  This minitrack invites authors to submit in-depth research that provides rich stories, unique insights, and valuable conceptual frameworks for information systems practice. Papers might be based upon single cases, multiple cases, field interviews, or, less commonly, literature itself.  Experimental research and survey research are less likely to achieve the goal of providing rich insight for practice.  While it is assumed that researchers are guided by theory, it is not expected that the submissions to this minitrack make distinct or novel theoretical contributions.  The contributions should focus on distinct and unique lessons for practice.  The minitrack chairs coordinate with MIS Quarterly Executive (MISQE) in selecting papers for fast-tracking to an issue of MISQE. Overall, this minitrack aims to: Showcase high-quality practice-oriented IS research Promote practice-oriented IS research as a key source of insight and guidance for digital leaders Provide researchers a platform to present and discuss their practice-oriented IS research findings and expose the community to current challenges in creating value with IT Help identify the most challenging managerial issues for digital/IT leaders and frame them as new questions to guide future practice-oriented IS research.   Additional guidance for authors of practice-based IS research papers This practice track has run for many years at HICSS. We are not just seeking research with strong relevance for practitioners, but manuscripts written in a way that makes them easily accessible to such a reader. This means that any accepted manuscript will not follow the traditional “rules” of writing for an academic audience. If you are not a regular reader of MISQ Executive, we would advise you to read a few articles to understand their style, structure, focus, and content. Some general guidelines for writing such articles include: Simplify reality, but do not be simplistic Keep theory and methodology in the background (perhaps include your methods in an appendix, but write it so that it is accessible to non-academic readers). Use literature and in-depth evidence to give credibility and generalizability. Typically, such articles loosely follow this structure: Short lead-in Motivate the practitioner reader in 2-3 sentences. Why should they read the article? What you write should resonate closely with them; perhaps it is a problem that they recognize that you are now going to help them solve. Short introduction to the topic Frame the topic of the article. Use footnotes rather than traditional academic referencing style when using prior research. Extensive research findings Use headings and figures/tables to communicate findings. Address solutions to managerial challenges. Present lessons learned from the research and recommendations. Possibly develop and/or use a practice-oriented framework to organize and present findings.  Actionable guidelines Actionable guidelines include action verbs, not passive verbs like “understand,” “assess, “think,” or “get commitment.”  Tell the reader what to do, or what to change.  For example, if getting commitment is important, say how to get the required level of commitment. Appendix Present an overview of research methods. Remember to write in a way that is accessible to an audience unfamiliar with academic research's nuances.  Fast Track to MISQE Selected articles will be fast-tracked to MISQE. There are typically several MISQE senior editors in the audience to offer guidance on presented articles. Marketing As in the past, this session will be marketed through AISWorld and the MISQ Executive website. Minitrack Proposal co-chairs:  Bill Kettinger William S.

The intent is to understand how technology affects strategy, how strategy affects regulation, the law, and social welfare, and how regulation and the law can best serve the interests of society. In addition to Economics and IS, we seek to engage a broader range of Social Sciences, including Anthropology, Sociology, Psychology, Public Policy and, of course, the Law. Each year, the SITES Minitrack has produced a Special Issue or Section of papers that are published in the Journal of Management Information Systems (JMIS), a Financial Times 50 journal. We are exploring whether it will be possible to do another SI again.  The Minitrack explores topics including but not limited to:  The new and evolving economics of uncertainty and information. Who are the “winners”? Who are the “losers”? Can interactions be designed, including possible regulatory intervention, to improve anticipated or observed outcomes? Case studies of the application of strategic IS and their impacts on firms, markets and economies Economic analysis of investments in IS in a wide range of competitive and commercial application areas, and the relationships between systems use and market share, profitability, business value, or other measures of competitive advantage and firm performance Strategic analysis of IT and cloud computing services, sourcing, and contracts Business strategy on the Internet, electronic markets and digital convergence Property rights, incomplete contracts, transaction costs and other theories to understand interorganizational IS Channel development, transformation and conflict in the presence of emerging technologies Product design with IT, and the bundling and pricing of physical and digital goods and services Technology innovations, process disruptions and business transformation associated with the Fintech Revolution  The Minitrack will also include a wide range of topics that may not be explicitly grounded in Economics. They include:  Privacy and privacy policies, including studies of consumer preferences and attitudes, and regulatory policies designed to balance the needs of the State for stability and self-preservation and the desires of citizens for anonymity and privacy Social networks and the changing nature of real-world relationships, including but not limited to changes in dating, consumer hospitality booking, and relationships between employees and their organizations, and between employees at competing organizations based on prior social connections Changes in competition law, antitrust law, and regulation, based on new online business models, including the new practices of the sharing economy Social networks and social change, ranging from increased social cohesion to violent regime change, as well as social welfare in light of tech innovations in society  Potential authors are welcome to contact the Co-Chairs to assess whether their papers will be appropriate for SITES any time after March 15. The deadline for final submission is mid-June, in keeping with the overall HICSS deadline in force. Authors who are interested in attending, but only to make a presentation and not have their papers included in the HICSS conference proceedings are also welcome to contact the Co-Chairs, to discuss what they wish to propose.  Marketing Plan:  The SITES Minitrack has had a long history at HICSS of offering strong developmental reviewing, helpful and feedback for authors, a lively presentation and discussion environment, and a follow-up special Issue of articles handled in fast-track mode for publication. Each year the Co-Chairs also reach out with invitations to new authors, to those who have presented in the past (including their Ph.D. students), and to people who can bring new topics to SITES under the general umbrella of the Minitrack’s Call for Papers. We also share the Call for Papers widely, by posting it in a variety of lists and sharing it with faculty colleagues worldwide. We also occasionally bring industry participants into the Minitrack for panel discussions and debates, although no commitments have ever been made to wave registration fees, pay for transportation, hotel stays, or per-diem expenses.

We hope to attract many more submissions this year by innovating in two ways. First, we want to solicit three paper types with specific author and reviewer requirements. These paper types will be 1. traditional research papers that make theoretical and practical contributions, 2. practice- or policy-oriented papers that describe an emergent innovation or law and the anticipated impacts of the innovation or law, and 3. teaching cases that help educators and students think critically about the social impact of technology. Second, we want to develop a special issue with Information & Organization for traditional research papers. This will help authors move their papers forward after they incorporate feedback from the conference. Our vision for the practice- and policy- oriented papers that describe new technologies is that they will serve as white papers that can be referenced by researchers, students, and educators who are trying to understand the basic functions and implications of innovative technologies that are entering the market. The teaching cases will be used in classrooms.     Call for Papers: The objective of this mini track is to foster a community of researchers who are interested in understanding how technology can be used for social impact, and in developing practical guidance for organizational, legal, and political leaders who are shaping policies and laws. We will consider three types of papers for this mini track: We will accept traditional research papers that make a theoretical contribution to knowledge about technology. These papers will be reviewed in a traditional manner. These papers will be considered for a related special issue at Information & Organization.    We will accept practice- or policy-oriented papers that describe an emergent innovation or law and the anticipated impacts of this innovation or law. These papers will clearly articulate practical or policy implications. They will be written in a way that makes a complex technology or law understandable to readers from a variety of backgrounds. We will accept teaching cases that help educators and students think critically about the social impact of technology. These papers will include discussion questions to help students and educators think through the potential future impacts of technology.  In this mini track, we seek to advance understanding of how technology can be designed, developed, implemented, and governed for positive social impact. We are also interested in learning more about the dark sides of technologies and regulatory environments. We want to understand how technology improves or worsens societal, organizational, group, and individual conditions. We will give special consideration to papers that articulate implications for corporate, legal, and political leaders. We will also give special consideration to papers that articulate implications for systems designers, IT managers, or voters. The following list of potential topics is not meant to be exhaustive:  Type 1 Papers: Traditional Research Technology and social good (e.g., emancipation, dignity, social justice, inclusion, empowerment, collective and connective action, activism, social movements, transparency) Technology and social ills (e.g., surveillance capitalism, excessive algorithmic management, privacy violations, oppressive work conditions for gig workers, digital divide, inequity, exclusion, terrorism, cybercrime) Type 2 Papers: Practice- or Policy- Oriented Descriptions and implications of innovations (e.g., vaccine passports, blockchain, big data, virtual reality, employee wearables and trackers, algorithmic management, smart homes) Descriptions and implications of policies and laws (e.g., PACT Act, remote work policies, PRO Act, algorithmic hiring policies, COPPA, UNESCO, gig worker policies, ADA, privacy policies) Type 3 Papers: Teaching Cases Cases and discussion questions to help educators and students think critically about the positive and negative impacts of technology for individuals, groups, organizations, or society.   Marketing Plan:  This track attracted high-quality papers for HICSS-55 and we received enough papers to maintain a 44% acceptance rate. We hope to recruit even more submissions for 2023. We have innovated to include two additional paper types. We will reach out to individuals to solicit papers for these new categories. We will continue to publicize this mini track to audiences close to our respective backgrounds – management information systems, accounting information systems, and communication. Efforts will also be made to reach social science and information science audiences. We will employ MIS, IS, IT, and Communication “call for papers” distribution lists and professional organization listservs. We will engage in promotion to similar and related audiences on Facebook and LinkedIn. We will send out a call for papers in March, April, May and early June. Specifically, we will announce the mini track monthly on AISworld, OCISnet, and to the AIS special interest group SIG-Social Inclusion. We will also send individual emails to past authors in this and other related mini tracks from both HICSS and other conferences, as well as emails to authors discovered from a targeted search in this area.   Mini track Co-Chairs: Amber G.

Central to this research agenda is exploring and understanding  the role of digital technology and information in the constitution of organizational life. The minitrack is  interested in various socio-technical issues in traditional organizational settings as well as in emergent and  alternative forms of organizing such as online communities and social movements that are afforded by  platforms and social media.  Socio-technical  issues  include  research  topics  of  information  systems  planning,  development,  implementation and use, which are especially attentive to the underlying social and organizational relations  within which such systems are embedded.    Such topics include the conceptualization of specific socio-technical issues, and the practices and processes  of their emerging and enacting/performing; the empirical illustration and validation of established or new  conceptual perspectives; and case studies offering insights into both socio-technical processes of success  and failure.   Some key topics may include: (1) organizational culture and identity, (2) inter-organizational relationships,  and (3) management and leadership. Authors are invited to submit papers that may address, but are not  necessarily limited to, any of the following topic areas concerning socio-technical issues in organizational  or inter-organizational contexts.  1.  Organizational Culture and Identity  o  Digital  culture  (Digital  mindset,  Cross-functional  collaboration,  Agility,  Dynamic  capabilities)  o  Organizational change and routines  o  Organizational identity and major organizational changes (ex. Digital Transformation,  Outsourcing, Mergers and Acquisitions)  2.  Inter-organizational Relationships  o  Development of digital ecosystem partnerships  o  Boundary spanners, boundary objects, knowledge transfer  o  Organizational ambidexterity  o  Absorptive capacity  o  Open Innovation  o  Distributed forms of working and organizing, Hybrid work models  3.  Management and Leadership  o  Recruitment and retention of digital talent   o  Team management in a COVID-19 context  o  Digital leadership, Complexity leadership  o  Algorithmic control and managerial oversight in the Gig Economy  o  Work-related stressors (worker surveillance/monitoring, technostress)     We invite contributions that engage philosophically, theoretically, methodologically and/ or empirically  with various socio-technical phenomena. Submissions may include, but are not limited to research papers  (conceptual, theoretical, and empirical), as well as case studies, and best practices/lessons learned. We also  welcome research-in-progress studies that strive to problematize or transcend established boundaries  (theoretical, disciplinary, methodological etc.).     The Call for Papers (CfP) advertising will be based, as usual, on postings on social media (Facebook,  LinkedIn), on the AIS community CfP tool, and on communication within the extended network of  colleagues and collaborators in Canada & U.S., Sweden, Ireland, Germany, and Netherlands.

We are looking for  contributions that break with well-trodden empirical and conceptual conventions to help academia build  a novel set of concepts and instruments to generate useful theory for shaping digital future(s).    For us, this objective is soundly anchored in the Information Systems discipline’s increasing interest in the  process and implications of global, societal, economic, and individual digitalization. We particularly think  of this challenge as one where analyses and extrapolation from the present fails to provide meaningful  insights beyond projecting that status quo into the future, albeit in a more technicized version of itself.  Rather, we seek ways for science to become more insightful, informative, and instructive to active shapers  of post-digital life worlds– or even to become an active shaper itself.    Exciting submissions will approach the challenge we are presenting by making either a theoretical  contribution or a methodological one. In the former, we are looking for advances in the role and  development of forward-looking theory in IS research and encourage research that rethinks the processes  of theory formulation, theory replacement, or theory envisioning. The latter will contribute to a collective  effort to build methods for engaging with future and possible worlds. Current future-studies approaches  (e.g., scenarios; technology foresight) could be extended into new realms. Of particular interest are papers  which present speculative or creative processes to address questions regarding, for example, specific  methodological setups of studies engaging with post-digital futures, the meaning and evolution of  scholarly quality criteria (e.g., rigor or validity), or ways of engaging those with a stake in the future. Papers  which use the future as a site of inquiry to inform present research and action have a great potential of  being considered for our mini-track’s intended program.    We continue our mini-track’s mission to challenge scholars to focus attention on “new phenomena,  disclose new perspectives on phenomena, and illuminate new research agendas and programs” against  the background of, and pushing past existing theorization and methods. We encourage interested  contributors to review the mini-track’s calls for papers from previous years to further illuminate the  thinking which will guide our review and editorial decision processes.    Prospective authors are advised that the track does not look for topical contributions which are best  submitted to one of the conference’s other (mini-)tracks. Papers in this mini-track must explicitly  provide the basis for more speculative future-leaning conceptualizations of phenomenon or provide  insight on how to provide such concepts.

It is set up to provide a forum for papers in the Organizational  Systems and Technology track that do not “fit” exactly in a specific track. We often serve as an  incubator for new ideas.    Over the years we have actively solicited non-traditional, imaginative, and thought-provoking  research in any IT area. We are particularly interested in papers that break new ground in new  areas, or those that apply existing research to new industry groups or fields.    The papers that we accept generally have the following characteristics:    1.  They are cross-disciplinary – can be disciplines other than MIS  2.  They address current topics that are important to today’s managers  3.  They have a practitioner “flavor.”  4.

"HICSS-56","OS","Organizational Systems and Technology","bd00f89d-1cae-465a-b990-42f3ead4d68d","Advances in Trust Research: How Context and Digital Technologies Matter","Proposal for HICSS-56     TRACK: ORGANIZATIONAL SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY        Minitrack: Advances in Trust Research: How Context and Digital Technologies Matter    03-06 January, 2023  Maui, Hawaii  http://hicss.hawaii.edu    Within the 56th Hawaiian International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS), we organize a  minitrack on “Advances in Trust Research: How Context and Digital Technologies Matter.” The  56th HICSS, one of the most prominent conferences on Information Systems and Sciences  worldwide, will be held January 03-06, 2023 (http://hicss.hawaii.edu).     Due  to  advances  in  digital  technologies  and  increasing  access  to  vast  amounts  of  data,  organizations continue to innovate in order to enhance or augment various internal and external  activities, work processes such as decision-making, coordination, and control. Examples include,  but are not limited to the algorithmic management and control of workforce, face-recognition tools,  security and predictive policing applications, the usage of blockchain technology, people analytics,  the wide-spread of digital platforms, and sophisticated robotics.     Trust is pivotal in order to effectively and efficiently manage novel digital technologies. Trust is  the positive expectation of the conduct of the referent in a specific situation involving perceived  risk or vulnerability. For example, trust may decrease reluctance of workers exposed to complex  black-box algorithms, or increase the satisfaction among customers of voice assistant devices. Yet  it is important to note that the crucial role of trust may differ across different types of technologies,  applications, use cases, professional, organizational, and cultural contexts. Research has not paid  sufficient attention to the context where new digital technologies are developed, brought to  markets, implemented, and adopted. Research is needed to increase our understanding about trust  at different levels of analysis, i.e., individuals, teams, organizations, meta-organizations, and  society. In addition to the nature of digital technologies, also the use cases differ considerably. For  example, trust in a human that uses AI to augment their skills in a health care setting, such as a  radiologist distinguishing Covid-19 from pneumonia,  is very different from trust in a large tech  giant that collects vast amounts of data about their customers to expose them to targeted content.  The characteristics of digital technologies differ considerably, and a rule-based algorithm can  hardly be compared with a complex self-learning AI algorithm. Trust in the context of self-driving  cars may be very different from trust in smart contracts embedded in blockchain technologies.  Rather than treating trust and digital technologies as static and isolated concepts, we need to  increase our understanding of the specifics of respective technologies and the contexts they are  embedded in.  Additionally, research is needed on how trust influences reliance intentions on the  referent across these different contexts.    We welcome papers that theoretically or empirically advance our understanding by addressing  advances in trust research and digital technologies in organizations. Particularly, we are interested  in papers that unpack the specifics of the information systems and technologies in question and  focus on the role of specific contexts in shaping trust beliefs. Papers can use any acceptable  methodology and theory. We welcome papers at any level of analysis and encourage papers that  take a cross-level and/or interdisciplinary perspective. Some possible topic areas include but are  not limited to the following:    ●  Differences of trust in rule-based (non-learning) compared to complex learning (AI)  algorithms  ●  How does trust in the same digital technology differ across different contexts (e.g., the  algorithmic management and control of workforce, face-recognition tools, security, and  predictive policing applications)?  ●  How does trust in digital technologies differ across institutional and cultural contexts, e.g.,  with different regulation, legislation, organizational or professional cultures? Different  forms of distrust and trust and the future of work on digital platforms and in organizations   ●  How does distrust and trust research help us to make sense out of the changes in the  workplace from the COVID-19 pandemic?  ●  Different approaches to trust in AI compared to trust in non-learning contexts  ●  Understanding distrust and trust, the explainability of AI, and algorithmic transparency  ●  Understanding how distrust and trust in organizations is affected by computer-mediated  teaming, and how trust can be built to support in AI supporting computer-mediated teaming  ●  Understanding trust, distrust, vigilance, and surveillance in telework as well as people  analytics. When do trust and control coexist, and when do they hamper or support adopting  digital technologies?  ●  Understanding issues of digital trust, reputation, and risk in the context of computer  mediated teams and other platform-based organizations, e.g., in the digital platform, among  the users of the platform, in the organization behind the platform, in financial and other  transactions conducted through the platform.  ●  Understanding virtual reality, avatars, and distrust/trust research  ●  Understanding trust in AI and distrust/trust in work contexts in which organizations and  platforms employ algorithmic management and algorithmic control  ●  What are the possibilities and challenges in stakeholder participation to build trust in digital  technologies?  ●  Understanding  the  role  of  distrust  and  trust  in  the  development  of  algorithms,  e.g.,  functions, openness of coding, data collection.  ●  Understanding the relationship between an organization’s handling of its users’ data, e.g.,  privacy/integrity/security, use of the cloud, and trust in the organization  ●  How do changes in distrust/trust influence identity and identification processes?  ●  Understanding the role of distrust/trust between users and emerging technologies, e.g.,  teleconferencing, personal robots, smart toys, wearables, personal voice assistants, 3D  printing, autonomous vehicles, drones.  ●  Understanding  the  relationship  between  distrust  and  trust  and  the  development  and  dynamics of self-regulated, decentralized, peer-to-peer networks.  ●  How does distrust and trust change in blockchain technology and cryptography contexts?   ●  How does distrust and trust evolve in complex and multi-layered environments such as  digital platforms?  ●  Understanding the relationship between distrust/trust, identity, control, and influence in  digital environments.  ●  Understanding the role of AI and distrust/trust in complex organizational decision making  ●  Understanding how norms and policies at organizational level influence distrust/trust in AI  or automation development and adoption    Trust is an interdisciplinary research area. Co-minitrack chairs include accomplished scholars on  trust beyond information systems including management and psychology.     Marketing Plan: We will announce the minitrack monthly on AISworld, CTOnet, EGOS and FINT  network and newsletters (global network for over 7 50 trust researchers), AOM divisions and  Human Factors listserv as soon as the minitrack is approved. We will also send individual emails  to past authors on this and other related minitracks as well as our colleagues worldwide who are  interested in this area.  Each minitrack co-chair is committed to participating in sending emails to  prospective authors in their own networks.

We	also	 seek	to	explore	how	these	concepts	can	be	leveraged	in	other	contexts	(such	as	data	 science	or	engineering),	and	more	generally,	how	to	expand	the	use	of	agile	and	lean	 beyond	software	development.			 Further,	as	an	addition	for	2023,	we	seek	to	make	it	easier	for	practitioners	to	submit	an	 experience	report	by	offering	to	match	potential	experience	report	writers	with	someone	 who	has	previously	written	HICSS	papers,	and	so,	can	help	document	the	practitioners	 experience	within	the	standard	format	/	structure	of	a	HICSS	paper.	Practitioners	seeking	 this	support	should	reach	out	to	a	mini-track	co-chair	prior	to	submitting	an	experience	 report.	 Our mini-track seeks to answer questions such as:	 •  What	guidance	can	we	provide	to	product	leaders,	managers	and	developers	to	help	 motivate,	create	and	sustain	better	agile/lean	behaviors	and	more	profitable	 outcomes?		 •  How	can	we	incorporate	product	design,	architecture,	engineering,	risk	reduction,	 budgeting	and	offshoring	into	agile/lean	while	preserving	empiricism,	 experimentation	and	adaptation?		 •  How	can	agile	and	lean	can	be	integrated	within	a	single	coherent	approach?	 •  Which	metrics	help	enterprises,	teams	and	individuals	adapt	and	improve?	What	 common	behaviors	do	we	see	in	agile	or	lean	teams	and	how	do	those	behaviors	 affect	outcomes?		 •  How	do	organizations	and	cultures	restructure	to	support	these	philosophies	and	 when	they	do	not	restructure,	what	happens?		 •  How	do	organizations	implement,	monitor	and	improve	hiring,	coaching,	training	 and	mentoring?		 •  How	does	agile	scale	(such	as	coordination	between	agile	teams,	interfacing	 between	agile	principles	at	a	project	or	enterprise	level),	including	comparative	 results	on	the	use	of	different	agile	scaling	frameworks?	 •  How	can	agile	be	implemented	within	other	contexts	(e.g.,	data	science)?	 •  How	do	agile	and	lean	principles	extend	to	DevOps	environments?	Is	there	a	 difference	between	agile	and	lean	before	and	after	deployment?	How	are	post- deployment	issues	and	opportunities	in	software	projects	impacting	planning	and	 development	of	software	development	projects?	     Possible additional topics for the mini-track include but are not limited to:  •  Empirical	outcome	comparisons	in	industrial	settings:	agile	and	non-agile,	remote	 and	collocated,	impact	of	different	agile	or	lean	methods,	etc.	 •  New	frontiers	in	agile	or	lean	management	–	going	beyond	software	development	 •  Forecasting,	risk	reduction,	planning	 •  Exploring	the	fit	between	agile	(or	lean)	organizations	and	their	environmental	 context.	 •  Agile	and	lean	requirements	engineering,	dependency	management	and	risk	 management	 •  Conflict	in	agile	or	lean	organizations	and	their	development	teams:	what	cultures	 work	and	don’t	work?	 •  What	cultures	and	leadership	characteristics	lead	to	sustained	agility?	 •  Evolution	of	agile	or	lean	organizations	 •  Case	studies	on	agile	or	lean	management	and	experimentation,	in	atypical	 situations	 •  Impact	of	tool	use	on	agile	or	lean	management	 •  New	approaches	to	teaching	and	coaching	agile	or	lean	organizations	 •  Lessons	learned	in	agile	and	lean	management	 •  How	do	agile	and/or	lean	management	compare	with	traditional	management?

Alex	Sutherland,	Scrum	Inc.	 Alex	is	a	serial	entrepreneur	with	a	decade	of	experience	practicing	Scrum	both	as	a	 developer	and	as	a	product	owner.	He	first	learned	Scrum	in	2007	by	attending	one	of	 Scrum	Inc.’s	first	Scrum	Master	classes	and	has	used	it	since	to	envision,	create,	market,	 and	sell	software	products	to	customers	around	the	globe	across	multiple	industries.	Prior	 to	becoming	an	entrepreneur,	Alex	was	a	graduate	student	in	Game	Theory	at	Caltech	and	 released	the	first	commercial	Nash	Equilibrium	solver	for	Poker.	 	     Background  An	agile	approach	focuses	on	using	a	cycle	of	experimentation,	inspection	and	adaptation	to	 improve	production.	Agile	is	most	often	applied	to	software	development,	and	we	expect	 many	papers	in	this	mini-track	to	discuss	software	organizations	and	software	engineering	 practices.	However,	we	also	welcome	papers	that	describe	other	types	of	organizational	 “production”,	such	as	business	intelligence,	management	initiatives,	manufacturing,	 marketing,	sales	and	finance.	 A	lean	approach	focuses	rapid	experiments	by	trying	to	continually	reduce	waste	and	 minimizing	work-in-progress.	Lean	has	recently	been	popularized	as	a	construct	for	start- up	organizations	(“Lean	Startup”	or	“Lean	Entrepreneurship”).			Advocates	claim	a	lean	 approach	produces	greater	market	satisfaction	and	customer	engagement,	earlier	 discovery	of	hidden	market	opportunities,	higher	revenues	and	more	efficient	use	of	 development	staff.	 These	approaches	claim	superiority	in	new	product	development	over	traditional	 approaches	(such	as	“waterfall	management”)	that	fail	to	test	development	and	market	 assumptions	in	long-range	plans.	 Agile	and	lean	approaches	challenge	organizations	large	and	small.	People	typically	 conflate	small	failures	(learning)	with	large	failures	(organizational	threats),	assume	that	 innovation	means	taking	long-range	untested	risk,	and	establish	and	protect	budgets	with	 many	baked-in	production	and	market	assumptions.	These	cultural	realities	interfere	with	 agility	and	real	innovation.	 As	a	result,	companies	often	invest	enormous	amounts	of	money	in	incomplete	or	 abandoned	agile	transformations.	What	can	organizations	do	to	improve	agile	uptake?	How	 do	we	know	that	the	organization	is	improving?	How	can	organizations	diagnose	problems	 without	motivating	gaming?	What	types	of	people	are	more	likely	to	thrive	in	agile	and	lean	 organizations,	and	what	roles	should	they	take?	What	hiring	practices	result	in	better	 candidates?	What	training	programs	produce	better	results?	What	coaching	structures	 work?	How	do	we	measure	these	activities?	 Marketing Plan  •  Solicit	key	influencers	in	agile	and	lean	practices.	This	will	combine	mailing	lists	 from	the	mini-track	co-chairs,	who	are	active	in	the	Scrum,	agile	and	lean	academic	 and	professional	communities.	 •  Continue	a	practice	of	marketing	HICSS	as	a	place	where	“systems	thinkers”	get	 together,	from	a	variety	of	fields.	Attendees	and	speakers	will	benefit	from	exposure	 to	more	fields	(and	markets	for	their	research).	 •  Market	this	session	and	venue	as	a	place	where	the	agile/lean	academics	and	 professionals	can	meet,	discuss	and	collaborate	on	agile	and	lean	startup	 implementations	for	enterprises,	small	groups	and	individuals.

"HICSS-56","ST","Software Technology","f6b4c39d-5f88-46e3-bb06-d312afcd4e04","Blockchain Engineering","Title of a minitrack: Blockchain Engineering  Research track that this minitrack belongs: Software Technology Track  Description of the minitrack:  This minitrack is a timely forum because the global interest in blockchain has rapidly increased beyond cryptocurrencies and “enterprise blockchain” has been making great strides in becoming a mainstream. Blockchain indeed represents a paradigm shift from centralized computing to decentralized. The intense interests in blockchain center around the decentralized system’s ability to provide transparency, security, (pseudo-) anonymity and data integrity without any third-party organization in control of the transactions; it thus can enable trustless transactions and disintermediated societies. This minitrack aims at providing a forum for addressing the challenges arising from the paradigm shift and the “how to” of engineering an enterprise blockchain system that can fundamentally change how business value is created, discovered, and realized. Different from other minitracks which mainly focus on the use cases of blockchain technology, the main focus of this minitrack is on the design and engineering issues of enterprise blockchain systems.  This minitrack calls for research on blockchain engineering.  Topics include but are not limited to:   Blockchain system analysis and design addressing paradigm shifts, including technical, organizational, legal and social aspects; Engineering blockchain combining/integrating with advanced technologies, including Big Data, Operating Systems, Artificial Intelligence, and Internet of Things (IoT) for enterprise information systems;  Agile processes for blockchain software development; Practice-based blockchain system development:  case studies, cost/benefit analysis, etc. Tools for blockchain system development and community management; Scalability, security and dependability in blockchain and smart contracts; Architecting blockchain platforms; Blockchain enabled trustless computing; Advancement of core techniques, including consensus mechanisms, incentive mechanisms, decentralized governance policies, smart contract engineering, etc. New Dapps (Decentralized applications) and business models enabled by blockchains;  Economic comparisons of blockchain technology with the traditional systems;  Etc.   Marketing plan, i.e., how do you plan to solicit papers:  Blockchain-related topics have drawn significant attention from academics and practitioners.   This minitrack is particularly suited for Software Technology Track at HICSS because of its focus on the “engineering” aspect of blockchain which complements other blockchain-related minitracks in HICSS which focus on the applications of the technology.  We plan to market this minitrack to Computer Science, Software Engineering, and IS departments of major universities in the world as well as blockchain divisions in enterprises and professional service providers, including outsourcers.    We will also publicize this minitrack in major software engineering conferences such as ICSE, ICSA as well as IS conferences:   AMCIS, DSI, ICIS, etc.  Name, affiliation, and contact information of minitrack chair (primary contact) and co-chair(s) Dr. Hong-Mei Chen   (*Primary contact)           Professor of Information Technology Management Shidler College of Business University of Hawaii at Manoa 2404 Maile Way,  E601 Honolulu, HI  96822  USA Tel.	+1.808.956.7286 Fax	+1.808.956-9889 Email	              Dr.  G.

Minitrack Title    Cyber Security and Software Assurance    2. Descriptive Paragraph  Modern society is irreversibly dependent on software systems of astonishing scope and  complexity.  Yet despite best efforts, errors, vulnerabilities, failures, and compromises  continue to persist.  Networked systems with complex hardware and software  components embody many pathways that adversaries can exploit.   Experience shows  that contemporary cybersecurity and software assurance methods are insufficient to  meet this challenge.  Each day, cybersecurity demands our attention.  From working on  laptops to loading apps on phones to evaluating the safety of software-enabled devices,  we must decide how best to protect information and services in an enlightened  approach that balances practical issues of cost and functionality.   There is increasing  recognition of the need for rigorous foundations for cybersecurity and software  assurance.  This minitrack focuses on how to enable development and application of  these foundations.  We ask: How should research and development move us toward a  solid basis in understanding and principle?  The goal is to develop science foundations,  technologies, and practices that can improve the security and dependability of complex  systems.  This minitrack will bring together researchers in cybersecurity and software    1  assurance in a multidisciplinary approach to these problems. This min-track nomination  was selected as best paper for the HICSS-48 Software Track.    Our minitrack invites work embracing multiple perspectives, levels of abstraction, and  evaluation of best practices and policies that help us to understand and assure the  security of complex systems. We welcome papers about tools and techniques in that  apply scientific and rigorous approaches or reveal underlying commonalities and  constructs.      3. Proposed Technical Areas    This  minitrack  addresses  all  aspects  of  cybersecurity  viewed  from  an  “enlightened  security” perspective. The following topics will be included in the minitrack:    •  Security ecosystem  •  Designed-in security  •  Tailored trustworthy spaces  •  Moving target  •  Cyber economics  •  Science of security  •  Multivariate detection and response  •  Co-evolution of defense and offense  •  Biologically-inspired security models  •  Holistic risk analysis  •  Hardware-enabled trust  •  Layered adaptable defense  •  Real-time coordinated response  •  Automated system interoperability  •  Authentication in ecosystem  •  Practical use of continuous monitoring  •  Confidence in activity prediction  •  Security visualization and prediction  •  Theories of vulnerability classification and control  •  Security measurement  •  Advances in information assurance theory and practice  •  Advances in specification, design, and implementation of assured systems  •  Advances in verification, testing, and certification of assured systems   •  Advances in software security analysis   •  Assurance for embedded systems and hardware components  •  Assurance for large-scale infrastructure systems  •  Information and software assurance in cloud computing environments  •  Assurance in system maintenance and evolution  •  Automated methods for information and software assurance  •  Assurance through computation of software behavior  •  Management of assurance operations  •  Processes and metrics for information and software assurance   •  Business case and ROI development for information and software assurance    2  •  Supply chain and standards issues in information and software assurance  •  Case studies of system assurance successes  •  Software testing        4.  Other Conferences    A number of other conferences address cyber security, for example:      •  Black Hat  •  IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy  •  Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC)  •  RSA  •  CSIIRW – Cyber Security and Information Intelligence Workshop  •  International Conference on Software Engineering  •  Software Assurance Forum   •  Annual Symposium on Information Assurance  •  International Conference on Information Assurance  •  AIAA Infotech Aerospace Conference    In general, these conferences tend to focus on individual aspects of security, attacks,  and countermeasures. Our vision for the HICSS Minitrack is to bring together a broad  spectrum  of  participants  in  assurance  research  and  application,  to  promote  cross- fertilization of methods in diverse subject-matter application areas. Technologies applied  and lessons learned in one subject-matter area may well inform advances in another.  Our goal is to help create a cross-discipline community of researchers that will continue  to  participate  in  HICSS  in  subsequent  years.  With  its  broad  focus  and  diverse  participation, HICSS is an ideal conference to play a leading role in improving the state- of-art in software and system assurance.      5.

We  especially encourage papers that emphasize cross-disciplinary approaches to cyber challenges.    Accepted papers will be presented via a high-energy, 10-minute format designed to spark audience  interest. The moderators will facilitate a high-quality Q&A format following the presentation.       A partial list of topics of interest includes:       0x00  Preliminary results in cutting-edge, high-risk, high-reward cyber research   0x01  Cross-disciplinary approaches to cyber security or trust  0x02  Cryptography, cryptanalysis, privacy, and security   0x03  Artificial and augmented intelligence applied to cyber systems  0x04  Network anomaly detection and novel approaches to securing OT  0x05  Modeling and simulation of cyber systems, security, trust, and risk   0x06  Social sciences and software technology applications to cyber systems   0x07  Human-machine interaction and optimization   0x08  Data science and big data solutions   0x09  Securing the cloud   0x0a  System adaptation, organization, optimization, and resilience      1      Marketing Plan  The co-chairs will continue to expand on prior years’ efforts to expand advertising reach through their  program and technical committees.    Technical committee membership is intended to be 10 and include the minitrack co-chairs.  Aside from  the co-chairs, confirmed TPC members include Dr. Santos Jha (MITRE); Dr. Paul Beery (NPS); Dr.  Thomas Parker (Univ of South Carolina); LCol Logan Mailloux, USAF, PhD (AFOSR); and LCDR  Ashley McAbee, USN, PhD (NSA Hawaii).    The program committee continues to grow their personal networks despite COVID.  The co-chairs will  engage existing research sponsors and ongoing research collaborators including Microsoft, George Mason  University, the Office of Naval Research, Naval Sea Systems Command, and the Naval Research  Laboratory to make minitrack submissions. During HICSS 55, the minitrack expanded their contribution  network to include Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) and UT San Antonio.  Additionally, we will  advertise the minitrack at the Naval Research Working Group, a Navy-wide research and development  synchronization conference hosted in April.     We will continue expanding last year’s mini-track social media marketing campaign leveraging LinkedIn  and multi-disciplinary conference advertising sites such as PaperCrowd and Wikicfp.    Other marketing methods:  1.  Dr. Bollmann’s role as the Director of the NPS Center for Cyber Warfare director affords him  national visibility and frequent engagement with the academic, national lab, and industry  communities interested in these research areas.  This network will be leveraged to advertise the  minitrack.  2.  Dr. Scrofani's role as director of a separate research center provides similar opportunities.  Dr.  Scrofani’s organization has stimulated research and development within these communities via  several public broad agency announcements, culminating in the award of several Department of  Defense (DoD) grants.  A consequence of these activities is that he maintains an expansive  network of organizations that conduct research in the areas of this minitrack and could submit  relevant papers.  3.   Dr. Scrofani teaches and advises in the National Capital Region, providing access to alternative  and independent groups of sponsors and researchers and facilitating strong ties with academics  and professionals at DoD, NSA, NGA, and other cyber-interested agencies.  4.  Drs.

Nowadays,  the concept is already applied in various applications from engineering to manufacturing and health  care. Thus, digital twins may affect the way people work or even their daily life. Therefore, it is often  also important to consider the effects of digital twins from the perspective of other fields like  psychology.     The topic of digital twins has been addressed recently at various engineering conferences like DAC,  DATE and ISORC, but usually with a strong focus on the engineering perspective and a rather  conservative notion of digital twins. We think that the idea of digital twins can be applied much wider  (e.g., digital twins of humans) and needs interdisciplinary coverage at a dedicated workshop.    The purpose of this workshop is to connect experts from academia and industry to gather an overview  of the current state in the application of digital twins and to discuss future perspectives and directions  for applications and research. For this, workshop participants are expected to submit and present  papers describing their current work and to participate in an open panel discussion.    Within the workshop the following topics are of particular interest:  •  Methods for creating digital twins   •  Platforms for digital twins  •  Digital Twin applications (e.g., smart cities, smart buildings, Car-as-a-Service (CaaS), …)  •  Impact of digital twin applications on industries, work and people    Submitted papers will be peer reviewed by at least three members of the program committee.    The workshop is planned as a half day event (3 hours). The first half will cover the paper presentations  (20 minute slots with discussion). The second half will be an open panel discussion.

The idea is to debate challenges of empowering edges of computer networks and adding computational intelligence to them.  An additional goal would be to analyse the future of the IoT and its speedy transformation into a constantly changeable set of new types of connected devices, typical of pervasive computing, which might be wearables, belong to soft robotics, represent computational materials, and enable human machine augmentations.  In all these examples, edge computing plays a very important role, and it is no surprise that we have started thinking how to equip the edges of computer networks with intelligence.  There are many challenges in the world of pervasive environments, typical of the IoT, where we wish to use edge computing.  Most of them stumble upon the potentially uncertain future of replacing powerful cloud computing with new paradigms in which intelligent edge computing may take centre stage.  Therefore, it is worthwhile exploring what exactly edge computing brings to the world of pervasive computing and how we could make this new computing paradigm become “intelligent edge”. Topics of interests include: Edge Computing Paradigm Evaluation of computational models for Cloud computing and their suitability for creating the IoT and pervasive environments in general. The role of Edge/Fog computing in making the IoT operational and reconsidering the role of Clouds in current IoT implementations Pushing data and computational intelligence, with analytic platforms, away from centralised Clouds and the rise of serverless computing Promoting localised computing, with Edge/Cloudlets/Fog in mind, and addressing the constantly changeable IoT, typical in pervasive computing. Examples of computing paradigms suitable for implementations of the IoT across Edge/Fog/Cloudlets/Clouds.  Creating Intelligent Edge Computing Feasibility of creating intelligence “at the edge” which could share computations and data between Clouds, Fog and Cloudlets.

Cognitive enabled edge computing and a journey towards human centred cognitive IoT, and pervasive environments in general. More explanation:  The edge computing has come of age, but there are not so many conferences which address the lack of computational paradigms and software architectures which could guarantee the existence of intelligent edge computing.  Research communities are still focused more on the issue of communication technologies and theories, connectivity of devices and interoperability, due to heterogeneities o HW/SW/platforms, but no-one talks about the issue of generating a new computational paradigm which creates an environment for and support the existence of edge computing.  Cloud computing is fading away and an intelligent computational edge may really be an answer in modern pervasive computing (which has changed beyond recognition since 1990).  The authors have had interest in the IoT an edge computing from different perspectives and we believe that we will be able to bring interesting papers to the minitrack from our past and current collaborative work. The co-hairs’ employers endorse their involvement and will pay for our travel and registration cost to attend HICSS.

Description of Minitrack:     The objective of this mini-track is to increase the visibility of current research and emergent trends in  Cyber-Assurance theory, application, embedded ‘zero trust’ security, artificial intelligence, and machine- learning for the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, and Edge computing architectures based on theoretical  aspects and studies of practical applications. Cyber-assurance is the justified confidence that networked  systems are adequately secure to meet operational needs, even in the presence of attacks, failures,  accidents, and unexpected events. Cyber-assurance means that 5G IoT systems, smart internet connected  devices (ICD) and networks provide the opportunity of automatically securing themselves against cyber- attacks. The difference is that the concept of cyber-assurance must provide embedded zero trust principles  (i.e., complete mediation) in ICD devices and virtual networks that can continue to operate correctly even  when subjected to an attack.    IoT devices rely heavily on 5G, and Edge computing systems and networks should be able to resist the  various security cyber-attacks such as hacking of networks, devices, theft of information, disruption, etc.  and  be  able  to  continue  performing  under  severe  environmental  conditions.  Through  embedded  processors and machine learning algorithms over the transmitted information, the miscoding and leaking  of information during transmission channels must monitor any loss, miscoding and leaking of data.  Timely adjustments of information with falling quality and automatic switching to the best routing IoT  systems by making uses of multi-directional routing is also warranted. Cyber-assurance will need to  provide the principles and technologies to unify these systems to deliver the end-state goal of secure IoT  systems for greatly enhanced interoperability, scalability, performance, and agility.    The target audience of this mini-track will be composed of researchers, professionals and students  working  in  the  field  of  cyber-security,  wireless  technologies,  information  system  theory,  systems  engineering, information security architecture and security system design along with university professors  and researchers involved in information assurance, cyber-security, IoT, 5G, and Edge computing related  networking. Through the research identified for this track, graduate students, researchers, and academics  who want to improve contribute their understanding of the latest security developments for the IoT, 5G,  and  Edge  computing.  This  minitrack  will  focus  on  the  architecture  and  security  needs  of  these  environments, highlighting key issues and identifying the associated security implications so that the  general participates can readily grasp the core ideas in this area of research. Recommended topics for this  track include, but are not limited to, the following:    •  Edge computing with 5G.  •  Zero trust architectures and designs for 5G, IoT, and Edge computing systems.   •  Implementing 5G security mechanisms in pervasive/ubiquitous computing.  •  Secure Cloud and Fog layer interaction through Edge networks.  •  Implementing privacy and security in 5G, IoT, and Edge devices and users.  •  Experimental results on spectrum effectiveness in End-to-End 5G systems.  •  Machine-to-Machine communication in 5G architectures and services.  •  5G joint management and orchestration of IoT networking with cloud technologies.   •  Research on automated 5G networks intrusion detection tools and techniques.  •  A.I./Machine learning algorithms used to spawn and control intelligent agents for information  assurance for 5G, IoT, and Edge computing devices and networks.  •  Security mechanisms for 5G , IoT, and Edge Networks.   •  Quantum algorithms and architectures for 5G, IoT, and Edge computing.

Especially the human factor of  information systems is a pivotal role in information security and increasingly relevant in  establishing user-privacy concepts. More often than not, their knowledge about security  aspects and ways of user-manipulation tactics are the last line of defense against cyber- attacks. However, studies show users are also seen as the weakest link in information security.  Therefore, they are also the primary target of attackers.   In addition to the traditional forms of user-computer-interactions in the form of mouse- keyboard-input-devices,  new  ways  of  system-interactions,  e.g.,  physiological  data  from  fitness-trackers, eye-tracking devices or even pupillary responses indicating cognitive-load- levels, are increasingly feasible as everyday HCI-components. With the interest in data privacy  increasing, are users aware how valuable those personal input data is and how do they value  data privacy measures?  Therefore, we have identified two main aspects relevant to researchers within the domain of  Software Technology: 1) how to securely deal with input data (also focusing on privacy  aspects) 2) how this data can be utilized in order to increase secure behavior or to raise  awareness among users (help the users to make better security-related decisions)    In this minitrack we seek papers that explore concepts, prototypes and evaluations of how  users interact with information systems and what implications these interactions have for  information security and privacy. Further, we welcome new and innovative ways of human- computer-interaction and security-related concepts currently examined in the field. Topics of  interest include but are not limited to:  •  Security related devices  •  Physiological sensors  •  Human-Computer-Interaction  •  Artificial intelligence  •  Blockchain applications  •  Sensor analysis  •  Data visualization  •  Biometrics authentication  •  Security and privacy awareness  •  Usable security design  •  Privacy and security by design  •  Privacy and smart contracts  •  User valuation of privacy  •  Validation of user data    Marketing plan:  We will announce the minitrack via  -  Research networks and social media (e.g., ResearchGate)  -  International mailing lists (IEEE Vis Mailing List, Eurographics Mailing List)  -  German mailing lists, such as German Society for Computer Science (Gesellschaft für  Informatik e.

Adaptivity is the capacity to learn and adapt to its environments,  especially considering various uncertainties.  A special emphasis of this minitrack is the inclusion of self-adaptive systems and applications in constantly  changing environments to facilitate reducing (re-)configuration, troubleshooting or maintenance during  operating phase.  This includes papers from the academic and practitioner community that propose technical solutions in  various domains, e.g., smart-manufacturing, -logistics, -mobility or –waste management. Furthermore, we  are looking for conceptual contributions dealing with novel systems and applications. We want to find out  how these domains can profit from self-adaptive systems and applications.   Among others, challenges of self-adaptive systems include dealing with uncertainties, communication  overhead, adaptation decision criteria and degree of decentralization, or model drift.

However,  what we are interested in, in the context of this mini-track, is how the concepts and ideas of  Smart Applications are realized, especially from a software engineering point of view. Thus, we  are looking for manuscripts on planned, currently developed, and/or already finished Smart  Application, IoT and Industry 4.0 projects, feasibility studies of all domains, and evaluations of  such applications in the real world. We want to see which architectures, frameworks, platforms  and infrastructures seem to be particularly successful.     The user community for smart applications is characterized by different stakeholders: from  researchers to policy makers to the general public. Thus, it is crucial to achieve easy-to-use  end-to-end solutions, which support the diverse roles in these communities and their different  interests and knowledge about smart applications. Such concepts are considered in so-called  science gateways (also known as virtual laboratories or virtual research environments), which  by definition serve communities with end-to-end solutions tailored specifically to their needs.     Software challenges for smart applications are broad, not only in regard to the breadth of the  community, but also to the breadth of topics. A specific focus of this mini-track is on how to deal  with the details of scenarios like handling huge data sets, high usage loads, complex event  processing on real-time data streams, sharing data between applications, security and so forth.  We also look for disruptive technologies, which influence Smart (City) Applications  development, e.g. 5G networks, Spatial Computing, Blockchain, Conversational Computing and  Autonomous Vehicles.

Majchrzak, University of Agder, Tor-Morten Grønli, Kristiania University College, and  Hermann Kaindl, TU Wien  Keywords: Mobile Computing, Mobile Device, IoT, Internet-of-Things, Cyber-Physical Systems, CPS  Minitrack Description  Applications for mobile devices (apps) have facilitated the success of smartphones and tablets. By us- ing apps, the multi-purpose hardware of modern devices can be utilized to the full extent. Despite  much progress in development methods, software development kits, and frameworks, app develop- ment poses many challenges. This is even more so for novel mobile devices such as wearables and for  the hardware that constitutes the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Compat- ibility, performance, battery-saving, and security and safety are only some of the issues that are mainly  driven by the quality of the used software. A satisfying level of this quality in many cases is very hard  to achieve and proper techniques for testing and formal verification are needed.  Experiences and methods from classical software development can only be utilized to some degree.  Moreover, the inherent challenges of the respective new devices ask for novel solutions. The chal- lenges sketched above are reinforced by the conditions that development activities meet. Typical par- ticularities include the need for multi-platform development, device fragmentation, context-sensitiv- ity, low computational power, little memory, energy conservation requirements, and the heterogene- ity of users. With the emergence of multi-platform and multi-device, the new golden standard are  applications not only across software ecosystems, but across hardware platforms such as laptop, mo- bile, tablets, embedded devices, sensors, and wearables. Therefore, new threads of research are  needed to tackle these issues and to pave the way for improved software development, better busi- ness producibility and improved user experience (UX).  Further, there are novel developments in machine learning and analysis, and the emergence of multi- faceted aspects of artificial intelligence (AI), ranging from algorithms to ethical AI, secure AI and sus- tainable AI perspectives. On mobile, IoT and CPS, this creates new opportunities for groundbreaking  research through distributed machine learning, federated learning, edge analytics and computational  collaboration between several heterogenous systems and device forms.  This minitrack started as Mobile App Development (HICSS-49 and HICSS-50) before broadening to Soft- ware Development for Mobile Devices, Wearables, and the Internet-of-Things (HICSS-51 and HICSS-52).  We then (HICSS-53, HICSS-54, and HICSS-55) adapted the minitrack to the continuously changing land- scape to keep it attractive to the community. Our minitrack invites researchers from software engi- neering, human-computer interaction, information systems, computer science, electrical engineering,  and any other discipline that contributes to the topics covered by our minitrack.  The minitrack is devoted to the technological background of mobile computing while keeping an eye  on business value, user experience, and domain-specific issues. Contributions may take a sociotech- nical view or report on technological progress. Topics of interests include the full spectrum of research  on mobile devices, IoT, and CPS, for example (but not limited to)  •  Case studies of development   •  Development methods, software architectures, and specification techniques  •  Economic and social impact, behavioral aspects  •  Software engineering education  •  User interface (UI) design and user experience (UX) research  •  Testing, simulation, and formal verification  •  Hybrid and cross-platform development, Progressive Web Apps (PWA)  •  Web technology  •  Security, safety, and privacy  •  Legal aspects of software  •  Energy-efficient computing  •  Sensor-usage  •  Machine learning on device  •  Collaborative applications and systems  •  The convergence between mobile devices, IoT, and CPS  •  Fog, edge, and dew computing and their computational applications  Minitrack Role for HICSS  Several minitracks at HICSS feature topics that deal with mobility. However, mobility as an overall topic  of prevalent importance for the anticipated digital transformation of society is still underrepresented.  Moreover, with the broadened scope the minitrack is less risky to be “cannibalized” by domain-specific  minitracks on mobility and will itself hardly “cannibalize” other minitracks. The minitrack will provide  an outlet for mobile computing and IoT- as well as CPS-related papers that do not specifically fit with  other minitracks, and it will continue to offer a meeting place for software engineers at HICSS.   Minitrack Marketing  The minitrack will be advertised in several ways.  Firstly, along with the general activities for HICSS, a Call for Papers (CfP) will be disseminated trough  the usual information systems research mailing lists such as AISWorld. Moreover, dissemination to  computer science mailing lists such as SEWORLD, DBWorld and EAPLS will be sought.  Secondly, indirect dissemination through the community will be stimulated. This will be mainly driven  through our board of reviewers, who work on the communities of mobile computing and related fields  and thereby can directly communicate the CfP to colleagues.  Thirdly, the chairs will solicit papers from their own network in research and industry.  Fourthly, a mailing list for attendants and supporters of the minitracks at HICSS-49 through HICSS-55  has been set-up. It will be used to further spread the CfP.  Follow-up Publication  We offered a LNBIP post-publication for the HICSS-52 edition of the minitrack. For HICSS-53 and  HICSS-54 we fast-track selected papers to be published as extended versions in the International  Journal of Pervasive Computing and Communications (IJPCC). We intend the same for HICSS-56.  2 / 3  Chairs and Program Committee  Minitrack Chair (Primary Contact):  Minitrack Co-Chairs:    Tim A.

Software has become a major driver for research with over 90% of researchers answering surveys that they use software for their research and over 65% expressing that they even could not do their research without software. The computational landscape has evolved from system-centered design focusing on training users to user-centered design delivering solutions that are intuitive and/or self explanatory. The prominence of research software creates challenges in the following areas - usability and ease of use, sustainability, and reproducibility. Thus, the concept of long-lasting, easy to use software accelerating science is a major concern for researchers. Additionally, researchers would like to be able to re-use software technologies to be able to analyze further data with established and verified methods, which is part of reproducibility approaches. The three concepts usability, sustainability and reproducibility are interconnected with each other and cover a wide range of application areas. They affect all layers of the software process - from enabling reproducing experiments via an easy user interface to using containerization for application portability. Such concepts are also relevant in the building of Science Gateways (also known as virtual laboratories or virtual research environments), which by definition serve communities with end-to-end solutions tailored specifically to their needs. The mini-track will focus on the broad spectrum of submissions that deal with complex scenarios such as containerization, strategies for long-lasting software, usability and user interface issues, handling data curation and provenance and more. Consequently, we anticipate submissions not limited to but in the scope of the following topics: ● Web-based solutions (web sites, science gateways, virtual labs, etc.) ● Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) ● Computational and Data-Intensive Workflows ● Novel approaches in containerization ● Sustainability practices in software development ● System architectures for testing and continuous integration ● Emerging best practices in Machine Learning software ● Best practices and Key Success Factors for usability, sustainability and reproducibility Marketing plan: If the minitrack gets accepted, we plan to invite international PC members from USA, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand to reach a wide intercontinental community. Additionally, we intend to distribute the CFP via our current projects and centers such as the Science Gateways Community Institute and to invite accepted submissions to a journal special issue on science gateways.The mini-track will be widely announced via a wide variety of projects the chairs are involved in. Since 2013, a special issue on science gateways has been yearly organized (co-edited by one of the chairs), which covers software technologies for science gateways as well as use cases from a wide variety of communities. If the minitrack proposal is accepted, selected accepted papers of the minitrack will be invited to submit an extended version to a future edition of this special issue.

These networks  include cellular networks (6G, 5G, 4G, 3G, and 2G), Wi-Fi networks, sensor networks, ad-hoc networks, Bluetooth, and more.  The breadth of this minitrack includes technical, social,  environmental and other issues. Technical issues are found in the protocol stack from the physical layer to the application  layer, including security, efficiency, scalability, the design and motivation of new systems,  novel applications, better use of existing technology, energy efficiency of communications,  regulatory issues, and in general, issues that are of concern when designing or building  cellular and wireless networks.  Often, technical solutions must be accompanied by relevant  social, environmental, or economic considerations which may be essential to the success of  the technology, so appropriate non-technical papers are also welcome in this minitrack. Description of technical area Cellular and Wireless Networks The research area of cellular and wireless networks spans diverse technologies and  applications including mobile broadband networks, wireless data networks, wireless sensor  networks, and wireless network security.  It includes technologies, such as LTE, NR, 6G, IoT,  WiFi, and Zigbee, and ranges from deployments on a national scale to small experimental  networks.  Papers in this field provide innovative solutions to challenges, whether new or well  established, where the most interesting portion of the network is wireless.  Such issues and  solutions will primarily be technical, but relevant social, environmental, or economic issues  are also appropriate for this minitrack. The defining property of cellular and wireless networks is the use of the wireless medium, with all its challenges and opportunities, to support communication, often among mobile systems.   Issues for such systems are as diverse as security, spectrum and channel allocation, cell  sizes and offloading, all the way to game-theoretic incentive designs and routing protocols.   Another defining property of cellular and wireless networks is their ubiquity, and this minitrack  welcomes any contribution that offers new insights into recent and emerging standards, such  as 5G and 6G, or into existing widely deployed networks. Support for mobility may range from cellular handoff to vehicle-to-roadside VANET applications and ad-hoc wireless networks.   Novel applications of wireless networks are also appropriate, especially if these applications  are enabled by recent advances in the technology.  Non-technical issues that may affect the  success or usefulness of a new technology, or issues of scale and experimentation and  evaluation of existing, practical networks are all relevant to this topic. Topical coverage The following is a partial list of research topics of interest for this minitrack:  6G, 5G, 4G, 3G, and 2G cellular networks  Wi-Fi networks  ad hoc wireless networks including mesh networks  wireless communication for the Internet of Things (IoT) and Vehicle Ad-hoc Networks  (VANETs)   wireless communication for home automation   security in wireless networks   protocols and algorithms for physical, MAC, routing, transport, and application layers,  including  cross-layer techniques  theoretical issues of interest in the design or implementation of wireless networks,  including communications, scalability, coordination, access control, and other  advances in the field, such as millimeter wave technologies  novel applications of wireless networks  social and environmental benefits and consequences of the use of wireless networks  and new applications. In general, this minitrack is expansive in welcoming submissions in any area related to  cellular and wireless networks including visible light communication.  Prospective authors are  encouraged to contact the minitrack chairs if they seek more detailed guidance. Marketing Plan Our marketing plan for this minitrack is multifaceted. As active researchers in the cellular and  wireless networking field, we attend other conferences throughout the year where we will  distribute fliers and make announcements about the minitrack.  In addition, we plan to contact past participants of the HICSS Wireless Networks minitrack.  We have been talking one-on- one with our colleagues to encourage them to submit papers, and will continue to do so.  We  will place an announcement on WikiCFP. Finally, since two of us are U.S. Government  employees, we have access to large internal U.S. Government networks where we plan to  release announcements and post details of the minitrack. A distributable and printable call for papers (CFP) is included as the last page in this  document. Suitability for HICSS This minitrack proposal builds on several years of prior success for the minitrack on wireless  networks, the minitrack on wireless sensor networks and the minitrack on wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks. Several prominent conferences exist that delve deeply into the technical foundations of  wireless networks, cellular networks, or both.  These include the IEEE Wireless and  Computer Networking Conference (WCNC) and the ACM International Conference on Mobile  Computing and Networking (MobiCom). These vertical conferences are primarily targeted at  computer scientists and electrical engineers and do not tend to consider the cross-section of  systems engineers and information scientists interested in the application and social impact of wireless networking technology. A minitrack on cellular and wireless networks is highly complementary to HICCS. The  systemic effect of cellular and wireless networking is already inherently discussed in sessions  throughout the conference. This minitrack allows those researchers exposure to future  directions in wireless networking technology that may impact the systems they are focused  on.
