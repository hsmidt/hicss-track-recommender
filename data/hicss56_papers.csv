We	also	 seek	to	explore	how	these	concepts	can	be	leveraged	in	other	contexts	(such	as	data	 science	or	engineering),	and	more	generally,	how	to	expand	the	use	of	agile	and	lean	 beyond	software	development.			 Further,	as	an	addition	for	2023,	we	seek	to	make	it	easier	for	practitioners	to	submit	an	 experience	report	by	offering	to	match	potential	experience	report	writers	with	someone	 who	has	previously	written	HICSS	papers,	and	so,	can	help	document	the	practitioners	 experience	within	the	standard	format	/	structure	of	a	HICSS	paper.	Practitioners	seeking	 this	support	should	reach	out	to	a	mini-track	co-chair	prior	to	submitting	an	experience	 report.	 Our mini-track seeks to answer questions such as:	 •  What	guidance	can	we	provide	to	product	leaders,	managers	and	developers	to	help	 motivate,	create	and	sustain	better	agile/lean	behaviors	and	more	profitable	 outcomes?		 •  How	can	we	incorporate	product	design,	architecture,	engineering,	risk	reduction,	 budgeting	and	offshoring	into	agile/lean	while	preserving	empiricism,	 experimentation	and	adaptation?		 •  How	can	agile	and	lean	can	be	integrated	within	a	single	coherent	approach?	 •  Which	metrics	help	enterprises,	teams	and	individuals	adapt	and	improve?	What	 common	behaviors	do	we	see	in	agile	or	lean	teams	and	how	do	those	behaviors	 affect	outcomes?		 •  How	do	organizations	and	cultures	restructure	to	support	these	philosophies	and	 when	they	do	not	restructure,	what	happens?		 •  How	do	organizations	implement,	monitor	and	improve	hiring,	coaching,	training	 and	mentoring?		 •  How	does	agile	scale	(such	as	coordination	between	agile	teams,	interfacing	 between	agile	principles	at	a	project	or	enterprise	level),	including	comparative	 results	on	the	use	of	different	agile	scaling	frameworks?	 •  How	can	agile	be	implemented	within	other	contexts	(e.g.,	data	science)?	 •  How	do	agile	and	lean	principles	extend	to	DevOps	environments?	Is	there	a	 difference	between	agile	and	lean	before	and	after	deployment?	How	are	post- deployment	issues	and	opportunities	in	software	projects	impacting	planning	and	 development	of	software	development	projects?	     Possible additional topics for the mini-track include but are not limited to:  •  Empirical	outcome	comparisons	in	industrial	settings:	agile	and	non-agile,	remote	 and	collocated,	impact	of	different	agile	or	lean	methods,	etc.	 •  New	frontiers	in	agile	or	lean	management	–	going	beyond	software	development	 •  Forecasting,	risk	reduction,	planning	 •  Exploring	the	fit	between	agile	(or	lean)	organizations	and	their	environmental	 context.	 •  Agile	and	lean	requirements	engineering,	dependency	management	and	risk	 management	 •  Conflict	in	agile	or	lean	organizations	and	their	development	teams:	what	cultures	 work	and	don’t	work?	 •  What	cultures	and	leadership	characteristics	lead	to	sustained	agility?	 •  Evolution	of	agile	or	lean	organizations	 •  Case	studies	on	agile	or	lean	management	and	experimentation,	in	atypical	 situations	 •  Impact	of	tool	use	on	agile	or	lean	management	 •  New	approaches	to	teaching	and	coaching	agile	or	lean	organizations	 •  Lessons	learned	in	agile	and	lean	management	 •  How	do	agile	and/or	lean	management	compare	with	traditional	management?

Alex	Sutherland,	Scrum	Inc.	 Alex	is	a	serial	entrepreneur	with	a	decade	of	experience	practicing	Scrum	both	as	a	 developer	and	as	a	product	owner.	He	first	learned	Scrum	in	2007	by	attending	one	of	 Scrum	Inc.’s	first	Scrum	Master	classes	and	has	used	it	since	to	envision,	create,	market,	 and	sell	software	products	to	customers	around	the	globe	across	multiple	industries.	Prior	 to	becoming	an	entrepreneur,	Alex	was	a	graduate	student	in	Game	Theory	at	Caltech	and	 released	the	first	commercial	Nash	Equilibrium	solver	for	Poker.	 	     Background  An	agile	approach	focuses	on	using	a	cycle	of	experimentation,	inspection	and	adaptation	to	 improve	production.	Agile	is	most	often	applied	to	software	development,	and	we	expect	 many	papers	in	this	mini-track	to	discuss	software	organizations	and	software	engineering	 practices.	However,	we	also	welcome	papers	that	describe	other	types	of	organizational	 “production”,	such	as	business	intelligence,	management	initiatives,	manufacturing,	 marketing,	sales	and	finance.	 A	lean	approach	focuses	rapid	experiments	by	trying	to	continually	reduce	waste	and	 minimizing	work-in-progress.	Lean	has	recently	been	popularized	as	a	construct	for	start- up	organizations	(“Lean	Startup”	or	“Lean	Entrepreneurship”).			Advocates	claim	a	lean	 approach	produces	greater	market	satisfaction	and	customer	engagement,	earlier	 discovery	of	hidden	market	opportunities,	higher	revenues	and	more	efficient	use	of	 development	staff.	 These	approaches	claim	superiority	in	new	product	development	over	traditional	 approaches	(such	as	“waterfall	management”)	that	fail	to	test	development	and	market	 assumptions	in	long-range	plans.	 Agile	and	lean	approaches	challenge	organizations	large	and	small.	People	typically	 conflate	small	failures	(learning)	with	large	failures	(organizational	threats),	assume	that	 innovation	means	taking	long-range	untested	risk,	and	establish	and	protect	budgets	with	 many	baked-in	production	and	market	assumptions.	These	cultural	realities	interfere	with	 agility	and	real	innovation.	 As	a	result,	companies	often	invest	enormous	amounts	of	money	in	incomplete	or	 abandoned	agile	transformations.	What	can	organizations	do	to	improve	agile	uptake?	How	 do	we	know	that	the	organization	is	improving?	How	can	organizations	diagnose	problems	 without	motivating	gaming?	What	types	of	people	are	more	likely	to	thrive	in	agile	and	lean	 organizations,	and	what	roles	should	they	take?	What	hiring	practices	result	in	better	 candidates?	What	training	programs	produce	better	results?	What	coaching	structures	 work?	How	do	we	measure	these	activities?	 Marketing Plan  •  Solicit	key	influencers	in	agile	and	lean	practices.	This	will	combine	mailing	lists	 from	the	mini-track	co-chairs,	who	are	active	in	the	Scrum,	agile	and	lean	academic	 and	professional	communities.	 •  Continue	a	practice	of	marketing	HICSS	as	a	place	where	“systems	thinkers”	get	 together,	from	a	variety	of	fields.	Attendees	and	speakers	will	benefit	from	exposure	 to	more	fields	(and	markets	for	their	research).	 •  Market	this	session	and	venue	as	a	place	where	the	agile/lean	academics	and	 professionals	can	meet,	discuss	and	collaborate	on	agile	and	lean	startup	 implementations	for	enterprises,	small	groups	and	individuals.	         ","ST","HICSS-56"," A model for DevOps adoption in Swiss SMEs ","DevOps is a new shift in business and information technology with the aim of closing the gap between development and operations. Current literature focuses mainly on the adoption of DevOps in large enterprises. Most of the resulting methods and frameworks are not suitable for smaller enterprises, which differ from large enterprises in many aspects. This paper examines small and medium enterprises and reports on research findings on how such enterprises have managed to successfully implement DevOps and for those who have not yet been able to implement it, how to overcome the challenges and obstacles they face during implementation. This is done by developing a methodology that describes the requirements needed for a successful DevOps implementation in SMEs. The proposed methodology has been tested in domestic Swiss SMEs with experts and internal IT development teams. We validated our findings and propose an adoption method, a checklist and a metamodel to facilitate the DevOps adoption process for SMEs looking to adopt DevOps. The results show that the developed method has practical implications and significantly simplifies the implementation process. However it needs to be adapted to the characteristics of the company before implementation.  "

Despite the  differences between approaches to esports, all emphasize its technological specificity and  competitiveness. In the last decade, esport has ceased to be seen solely as entertainment for  the youth and has become the fastest-growing sports area. This view is supported by the  increase in the number of events organized, their popularity among millions of viewers, and  the growing number and professionalization of gamers. Traditional sports are still bigger than  the biggest esports, making more revenue or player salaries. However, esports is quickly  catching up, given the growing number of broadcasted games, tournament prize pools, and  increasing advertising potential of esports games. Despite the increasing popularity of esports,  the research is still in its nascency. After an initial descriptive stage, the focus shifts from  explaining what esports is to a more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon.     This minitrack aims to provide insight into esports’ theoretical development and practical  understanding without excluding any methodological approach or scientific disciplines.  Conceptual, theoretical, empirical, and methodological contributions that enrich our  understanding of esports are welcome.     Given the diverse goals of this minitrack, possible topics include, but are not limited to:    •  Business, e.g. discovering esports consumers’ motivations; designing effective  marketing tools; understanding players’/esports’ networks and organizations;  gamers/fans as consumers.  •  Cognitive Science/Psychology, e.g. studying factors influencing athletes’  performance; their abilities and skills; cognitive and behavioral differences between  athletes.   •  IT, e.g. using game telemetry, biometrics, user-generated data, or text mining to study  esports, e.g. team dynamics, interactions of players; in-game performance.  •  Law, e.g. copyright issues   •  Sociology, e.g. gamers’ and athletes’ interactions and identities; live events and  streaming dynamics; gender issues (gender gap).  •  Media Studies, e.g. relations between esports, traditional sports, and the media; offline  spaces versus live-streaming, understanding esports in terms of virtual versus real;  how technology mediates gaming, and how esports’ communities fit here.  •  Sports Science, e.g., comparing esports and ‘traditional’ sports; esports as ‘real’,  ‘genuine’ sports or new quality.           Journals for fast track opportunities, if any:      Journal of Electronic Gaming and Esports       Marketing plan:    •  Using research networks and various associations, e.g. Esports Research Network;  Association of Internet Researchers; National Communication Association;  International Communication Association, European Communication Research and  Education Association.  •  Esports research journals (e.g. JEGE), conferences and communities.  •  Grassroots activism in this area.

These	approaches	claim	superiority	in	new	product	development	over	traditional	 approaches	(such	as	“waterfall	management”)	that	fail	to	test	development	and	market	 assumptions	in	long-range	plans.	 Agile	and	lean	approaches	challenge	organizations	large	and	small.	People	typically	 conflate	small	failures	(learning)	with	large	failures	(organizational	threats),	assume	that	 innovation	means	taking	long-range	untested	risk,	and	establish	and	protect	budgets	with	 many	baked-in	production	and	market	assumptions.

","ST","HICSS-56","How to organize DevOps’ teams in customer firms? A comparative case analysis ","DevOps has become the fundamental approach to IT development enabling fast sustainable delivery. Despite an extensive DevOps’ literature, very few scholars addressed the issue of teams’ structures. They underlined some teams' characteristics and proposed structure taxonomies, but without considering the effect of the firm's context on a structure choice. To cover this gap, we propose an organizational model for DevOps’ implementation, linking the perspectives of client firms and the consultant entity supporting DevOps’ deployment, as this configuration has become highly frequent in the current digital era. We explored three cases in the public administration, telecommunications, and banking sectors. Data was collected through participant observation and semi-structured interviews and thematically analyzed with Nvivo. Consequently, we contribute to academic literature and managerial practice by raising customer firms’ awareness on the essential and supplementary components of DevOps’ teams and their synergies, and of the contextual factors inducing variability on these entities."

The analysis of digitalization and digital artifact characteristics is crucial for instance for entrepreneurial and internationalizing firms, as the shift towards digitalization enables a more efficient and effective knowledge exchange that is pivotal for global business practice and sustained business performance in foreign endeavors. This is particularly relevant for firms targeting global markets since their inception a.k.a. “Born Globals” and for those doing so through digital infrastructures and ecosystem since their foundation “Born Digitals”. Success of their entrepreneurial activities, international business operations, management and marketing is depending on effective learning and knowledge coordination that yearly increases also as an effect of the ever more permanent changes introduced by Covid-19 pandemic to global business. Our minitrack covers aspects related to entrepreneurship, marketing, management, international business, digitalization, knowledge intensive firms like born digitals, and the role of information systems within these contexts. Given the increasing calls for research looking at the shifts in global knowledge innovation and entrepreneurial systems introduced by digital business and especially yielding from the pandemic, our mini-track invests a topic area that besides theoretical has an ever increased practical relevance, and thus will appeal to a much broader audience of academics and practitioners. We expect the submissions to follow this increasing trend. Consequently, our methodological and theoretical standpoints contemplate qualitative, quantitative, and mixed method research approaches, where cross-pollination of fields of research is particularly relevant. We welcome papers from researchers as well as practitioners. Potential topics in our minitrack may include, but are not limited to: Digitalization in the context of entrepreneurial, internationalizing firms or global organizations The role of digital artifacts in new entrepreneurial ventures, international new ventures, born globals, born digitals and other entrepreneurial firms Born digital firms, being digital from inception and featuring a digital infrastructure Business models of born digitals and internationalizing firms The role of cultural differences in managing and designing international customer relationship and other international marketing activities in the digitalized world Digital platforms in the context of international business and born digitals Managing global diversity and sustainability through digitalization and sharing economy Practitioner papers and field studies in topics above Changes spurring from the Covid-19 pandemic and impacting the global management activities of international entrepreneurial ventures","KS","HICSS-56","Digital Business Strategy and its Relationships: Literature Review and Opportunities for International Research","A company wishing to exploit the ongoing digitalization in international business settings needs a competitive digital business strategy. However, without awareness of relevant strategy content and crucial relationships, it will be difficult to formulate and implement such a strategy. Because research on digital business strategy is fragmented, this paper presents a systematic review of 67 articles published 2008-2021. The review identifies five categories of strategy content. A company’s prior digital knowledge is the dominant category of antecedents. Obstacles and enablers are the categories of implementation factors, while operational and financial categories represent strategy outcome factors. The paper presents opportunities for further international research in regards to content of digital business and its relationships. "

MINI-TRACK DESCRIPTION FOR PROGRAM ANNOUNCEMENT COVID-19 clearly demonstrated the importance and prevalence of collaboration technologies.  It radically changed the way we work and the frequency of use of various collaboration technologies. The pace of change looks only to accelerate as the metaverse and extended reality technology promise new possibilities for both in person and remote collaboration.  For over a decade, this mini track has examined the design, development, and evaluation of collaboration technologies.  The recent pandemic has demonstrated the impact of collaboration on organizational performance and has proven to be more critical than strategic orientation or market and technological turbulence.  Successful collaboration is often difficult. Groups and teams often need to overcome both physical and metaphorical distance. Other challenges include groupthink, dominance, lack of efficiency, lack of focus, overwhelming information, differing motivations, and uncertainty.   The challenge for researchers and practitioners alike is to design sustainable processes and systems within and between organizations that allow people, groups, teams and machines to collaborate successfully. This challenge has many dimensions that cross technical, behavioral, social, emotional, economic, and political boundaries. This mini-track invites papers that address the theory, design, development, deployment, and evaluation of collaboration processes and systems within and between organizations, groups, teams, and machines.

Creating documents in large-scale collaborations is a challenging task that requires an efficient workflow. The design of such a workflow has received comparatively little attention. Conventional solutions such as working on a single Microsoft Word document or a shared online document are still widely used. In this paper, we propose a new workflow consisting of a combination of the lightweight markup language AsciiDoc together with the state-of-the-art version control system Git. The proposed process makes use of well-established workflows in the field of software development that have grown over decades. We present a detailed comparison of the proposed markup + Git workflow to Word and Word for the Web as the most prominent examples for conventional approaches. We argue that the proposed approach provides significant benefits regarding scalability, flexibility, and structuring of most collaborative writing tasks, both in academia and industry."

An IOHMM-based model is developed to represent the office environment under different circumstances of heating sources. One year of time series data is observed and studied to learn the dynamics of the indoor thermal states. The uncertainty associated with the changing aspects of the indoor temperature and its dependence on the outdoor temperature is considered in the model development. The well-known Baum Welch and forward-backward algorithms are adapted to learn the model parameters. Then, the Viterbi algorithm is used to predict the maximum path of hidden states, leading to predicting the most likely future temperatures. A numerical application is presented to demonstrate the model development steps and the training and testing results. Finally, the model's performance is validated using leave-one-out cross-validation, which shows that the model has a prediction accuracy of about 78%."

This minitrack addresses the gap between data and methods in social science research by providing a venue to discuss methodological issues and approaches to conducting research with digital and social media data. We welcome papers related to methodological challenges for researchers including, but not limited to: (1) the need for new methods for data collection and analysis, (2) adaptations of existing methods (3) issues of representation and sampling, (4) ephemerality of social media and digital trace data, (5) holistic collection of digital social media data and associated content such as images/URLs/video, (6) preservation, archiving, and data sharing, and (7) impact of changing platform affordances, interfaces, designs, and APIs. Indeed, there has been an explosion of research using social media data to study human behavior and social interaction in almost every domain of social science. The body of literature using digital and social media data is growing at a staggering rate, but accompanying methodological contributions about the process of conducting research with digital and social media data remains thin. The existing methodological literature is typically tool or technology driven, and not a result of empirical examination of the data collection process.This leaves researchers without an understanding of how to approach or evaluate the social media data collection process, and in turn, how to appropriately interpret findings from this type of research. As a result, researchers, practitioners, and students are left to continually reinvent the wheel by learning through a process of trial and error. Journals for fast track opportunities, if any We are re-exploring opportunities for fast track opportunities.

Therefore, we can see their appearance in many areas, such as storing web pages/websites, business phone numbers, redirecting to an app download, business location, social media. The popularity of the QR Code is mainly because of its many advantages, such as it can hold a good amount of information, is small, easy to scan and read by a general RGB camera, and it can still work with some damages on its surface. However, there are still some issues. For instance, some areas needed to be kept untouched for its successful decode (e.g. the ``Finder Patterns"", the ``Quiet Zone"", etc.), the capability of built-in auto-correction is not robust enough, and it is not flexible enough for many applications such as AR. We proposed a new Colour Quick Response Code that has several advantages over the original ones: (1) there is no untouchable area, (2) it allows up to 40\% of the entire code area to be damaged, (3) it is more beneficial for Augmented Reality applications, and (4) it is back-compatible and readable by available QR Code scanners such as Pyzbar. From our experience, our Colour Quick Response Code is significantly more flexible on damage compared to the original QR Code. The proposed code is believed to be suitable in situations where standard 2D Barcodes fail to work, such as curved and shiny surfaces, for instance, medical blood test sample tubes and syringes."

According to PwC, 72% of business executives say that AI will give them a  competitive advantage in the future1. In fact, in many ways the future is already here. Several  repetitive  and  simple  tasks  that  were  typically  performed  by  humans  are  now  being  automated by AI bundled with other technologies, such as cloud systems, augmented reality,  (social) robots, IoTs, and wearables. Consequently, the ratio of tasks executed by machines to  humans is dramatically shifting. Human workers are rapidly being replaced with AI on many  fronts. For instance, in 2018 an average of 71% of total task hours were performed by humans  compared to 29% accomplished by machines. However, this average is expected to shift  dramatically in the near future with 58% of tasks hours expected to be performed by humans  and the remaining 42% to be handled exclusively by machines by 20222.     In a world of such rapid technological changes, it is paramount to have an overview of the  research being conducted in this discipline. Such an understanding of current developments  of AI and associated technologies enables us to envision the future workplace and its effect  on  human  employees.  These  insights  also  provide  guidance  to  employees,  teams,  organizations, and governments in creating a sustainable and synergistic workplace. Finally,  engaging in this research allows us to proactively counter any negative effects that may arise  from the changes in the work settings. Through this minitrack, we hope to create a platform  where researchers working on AI in the context of future of work can come together and  create collaborations that will allow them to capitalize on each other’s work.    SHORT MINI-TRACK DESCRIPTION   This minitrack focuses on the impact of AI on the various aspects of the workplace as it exists  currently as well as how it may evolve in the future. We seek papers that address the social,  technical, behavioral, attitudinal, emotional, or managerial aspects of AI in the workplace. The  unit of analysis can be individuals, teams, or organizations. All kinds of research are welcome  including but not limited to quantitative, qualitative, conceptual, or design-oriented research.    1 Bothun, D., Liebermann, M., and Rao, A.

In this regard, a fined-grain macro-level identification of individuals in a workplace through their protective gear plays a vital role in classifying and tracking the individuals present in a workplace at any point in time and as well as ensuring their safety. However, tracking through real-time video produces an enormous volume of unstructured data imagery which necessitate using an efficient cost-effective computer vision algorithm for extracting meaning from the videos. Recently, we have been witnessing a significant research interest on the utilisation of computer vision and deep learning methods on helmet detection for either industrial or surveillance applications. However, most of these studies focus only on a single helmet detection, and there is a knowledge paucity in using fine grain multi-class classifications of helmets in complex scenes. This work introduces an efficient and improved object feature detection, extraction, and matching, in particular, an improved SIFT algorithm, optimized using discrete wavelet transformation approach for image frames decomposition and rapid real time object processing."

First, the authors introduce the GPS spoofing attack(s) and present the system threat-model. Second, the authors present and propose methods of how AVs and self-driving cars can extract, as they travel along a trajectory, surrounding textual information through machine learning based Scene Text Recognition (STR). Next, the authors research and propose geospatial and machine-learning models which can be applied to the extracted textual information in order to build a text-based geolocation system for the purposes of validating the received GPS signal. Next, the authors empirically investigate, compare and contrast preliminary results related to the degree of accuracy and efficiency of the proposed text-based geolocation system towards the mitigation of GPS spoofing attacks. Fourth, the authors present a pathway to investigate, compare and contrast, from a systems-based deployment, in a real-world setting, the degree of accuracy and efficiency of the proposed text-based geolocation models towards the mitigation of the GPS spoofing attacks. The ultimate contribution of the paper is the lay the groundwork towards enhancing the current and future Autonomous Vehicle and self-driving car Cybersecurity eco-system by addressing its Achilles Heel, namely insecure and inaccurate geolocation due to GPS spoofing attacks."

","OS","HICSS-56","Overall Sentiment of Privacy, COVID-19, and Trust on the Adoption of a Digital Contact Tracing Application on College Campuses","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected higher education globally. Universities have adopted approaches from online classes to in-person instruction with measures such as testing and contact tracing to decrease COVID-19 spread. Some universities have begun to utilize digital contact tracing applications that allow for more effective con-tact tracing but come with inherent privacy concerns due to location data being gathered. To maximize the adoption rate of these applications and increase effectiveness, universities need to understand student sentiments and concerns regarding contact tracing on their campuses. This study investigates university student sentiments regarding digital privacy, COVID-19, and institutional trust. Significant factors are identified in predicting student willingness to adopt contact tracing on campus and the identification of privacy safe-guards that are most important to students. Based on these results and prior literature, a discussion provides recommendations to improve the ac-acceptance of digital contact tracing on college campuses for current and future pandemics."

Due  to  advances  in  digital  technologies  and  increasing  access  to  vast  amounts  of  data,  organizations continue to innovate in order to enhance or augment various internal and external  activities, work processes such as decision-making, coordination, and control. Examples include,  but are not limited to the algorithmic management and control of workforce, face-recognition tools,  security and predictive policing applications, the usage of blockchain technology, people analytics,  the wide-spread of digital platforms, and sophisticated robotics.     Trust is pivotal in order to effectively and efficiently manage novel digital technologies. Trust is  the positive expectation of the conduct of the referent in a specific situation involving perceived  risk or vulnerability. For example, trust may decrease reluctance of workers exposed to complex  black-box algorithms, or increase the satisfaction among customers of voice assistant devices. Yet  it is important to note that the crucial role of trust may differ across different types of technologies,  applications, use cases, professional, organizational, and cultural contexts. Research has not paid  sufficient attention to the context where new digital technologies are developed, brought to  markets, implemented, and adopted. Research is needed to increase our understanding about trust  at different levels of analysis, i.e., individuals, teams, organizations, meta-organizations, and  society. In addition to the nature of digital technologies, also the use cases differ considerably. For  example, trust in a human that uses AI to augment their skills in a health care setting, such as a  radiologist distinguishing Covid-19 from pneumonia,  is very different from trust in a large tech  giant that collects vast amounts of data about their customers to expose them to targeted content.  The characteristics of digital technologies differ considerably, and a rule-based algorithm can  hardly be compared with a complex self-learning AI algorithm. Trust in the context of self-driving  cars may be very different from trust in smart contracts embedded in blockchain technologies.  Rather than treating trust and digital technologies as static and isolated concepts, we need to  increase our understanding of the specifics of respective technologies and the contexts they are  embedded in.  Additionally, research is needed on how trust influences reliance intentions on the  referent across these different contexts.    We welcome papers that theoretically or empirically advance our understanding by addressing  advances in trust research and digital technologies in organizations. Particularly, we are interested  in papers that unpack the specifics of the information systems and technologies in question and  focus on the role of specific contexts in shaping trust beliefs. Papers can use any acceptable  methodology and theory. We welcome papers at any level of analysis and encourage papers that  take a cross-level and/or interdisciplinary perspective. Some possible topic areas include but are  not limited to the following:    ●  Differences of trust in rule-based (non-learning) compared to complex learning (AI)  algorithms  ●  How does trust in the same digital technology differ across different contexts (e.g., the  algorithmic management and control of workforce, face-recognition tools, security, and  predictive policing applications)?  ●  How does trust in digital technologies differ across institutional and cultural contexts, e.g.,  with different regulation, legislation, organizational or professional cultures? Different  forms of distrust and trust and the future of work on digital platforms and in organizations   ●  How does distrust and trust research help us to make sense out of the changes in the  workplace from the COVID-19 pandemic?  ●  Different approaches to trust in AI compared to trust in non-learning contexts  ●  Understanding distrust and trust, the explainability of AI, and algorithmic transparency  ●  Understanding how distrust and trust in organizations is affected by computer-mediated  teaming, and how trust can be built to support in AI supporting computer-mediated teaming  ●  Understanding trust, distrust, vigilance, and surveillance in telework as well as people  analytics. When do trust and control coexist, and when do they hamper or support adopting  digital technologies?  ●  Understanding issues of digital trust, reputation, and risk in the context of computer  mediated teams and other platform-based organizations, e.g., in the digital platform, among  the users of the platform, in the organization behind the platform, in financial and other  transactions conducted through the platform.  ●  Understanding virtual reality, avatars, and distrust/trust research  ●  Understanding trust in AI and distrust/trust in work contexts in which organizations and  platforms employ algorithmic management and algorithmic control  ●  What are the possibilities and challenges in stakeholder participation to build trust in digital  technologies?  ●  Understanding  the  role  of  distrust  and  trust  in  the  development  of  algorithms,  e.g.,  functions, openness of coding, data collection.  ●  Understanding the relationship between an organization’s handling of its users’ data, e.g.,  privacy/integrity/security, use of the cloud, and trust in the organization  ●  How do changes in distrust/trust influence identity and identification processes?  ●  Understanding the role of distrust/trust between users and emerging technologies, e.g.,  teleconferencing, personal robots, smart toys, wearables, personal voice assistants, 3D  printing, autonomous vehicles, drones.  ●  Understanding  the  relationship  between  distrust  and  trust  and  the  development  and  dynamics of self-regulated, decentralized, peer-to-peer networks.  ●  How does distrust and trust change in blockchain technology and cryptography contexts?   ●  How does distrust and trust evolve in complex and multi-layered environments such as  digital platforms?  ●  Understanding the relationship between distrust/trust, identity, control, and influence in  digital environments.  ●  Understanding the role of AI and distrust/trust in complex organizational decision making  ●  Understanding how norms and policies at organizational level influence distrust/trust in AI  or automation development and adoption    Trust is an interdisciplinary research area. Co-minitrack chairs include accomplished scholars on  trust beyond information systems including management and psychology.

As ad hoc collaborations become more prevalent, researchers and stakeholders alike will need to identify what features facilitate rapid and appropriate swift trust development, particularly in contexts comprising salient risk and high stakes. The present work builds on extant swift trust literature, investigating the relevance and impact of antecedents to swift trust in ad hoc dyadic team formation. In an appropriately powered, within-subjects experiment conducted online, we leveraged a vignette and examined what antecedents to swift trust were considered relevant in ad hoc dyadic team formation and the extent to which they affect trust. The results showed that antecedents varied in terms of their relevance and effect on trust, and we discuss how these results align with extant research and implications for future research investigating swift trust in ad hoc collaborations."

Investigating Usage Intention in Central Bank Digital Currency","Worldwide, central banks are working on the introduction of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) as a new form of currency for digital transactions in response to cryptocurrencies and a decrease in cash payments. We investigate usage intention in specific retail CBDC, the digital euro, for the first time, and study the topic from a user-centric perspective. The UTAUT model extended with additional factors identified to be of importance for individuals in digital payment research – trust dimensions and privacy concerns – was used. Our work accounts for 69.2% of the variance in a user's intention to adopt the digital euro in our survey with 303 respondents. The findings suggest that strategic decision-maker should focus on the creation of trust in the currency, underlying technology and the central bank. The digital euro's performance as a payment solution is found to be the most important factor for behavioral intention to use."

Organizations that consider themselves “learning” or “knowledge- based” organizations must develop a competent workforce using organizational learning strategies. Success in  organizations involves developing a variety of human factors for these changing competencies. In addition, due  to technological change, modification and revisions, many skills require updating for a competitive advantage in  the marketplace.   Innovation in learning organizations involves all the processes of creating, transferring, modifying, and retaining  knowledge over time. These updating processes may occur at the individual, group, or organizational levels. This  minitrack is devoted to and involves topics that would benefit the essential functions of organizations that use all  types of knowledge. The focus will examine current research on organizations and the knowledge workers within  to understand the how to select, and update current knowledge as well as behavioral strategies for learning and  competency maintenance and learning in order to gain a competitive advantage.  Proposed Research Area   Learning Organizations and Knowledge Organizations need to focus strategically to develop organizational  potential. There is a gap between current learning within organizations and their ability to create, acquire, select,  transfer, and manage knowledge to remain competitive. The workers within these organizations also need to  develop themselves through the selection and acquisition of specialized skills for the work of the future. What  they  change  and  use  as  their  current  knowledge  base  creates  current  competencies.  Effective  knowledge  management strategies are needed to strengthen these organizations and will benefit from well-directed research  in these areas.   This mini track highlights examining the role of knowledge in organizations and individuals. How it is decided to  change, update, use, or disregard knowledge elements and how it is determined to intentionally suppress existing  knowledge is of interest. This mini-track therefore, expresses diversity of organizational learning methods within  a Knowledge Management framework. It seeks to explore different ways in which organizational knowledge base  is created, used, and modified. The lens to view organizations may be diverse; organizations using socio-technical  systems, where the term knowledge base could broadly refer to individual or organizational knowledge (i.e.,  organizational and individual goals, norms, and processes) or refer to machine knowledge (i.e., information  systems, data stores, and analytics) that can be applied or put into action.   Several factors that affect the success of knowledge base change within knowledge and learning organizations  will  be  limited  to  research  in  the  following  areas:  organizational  cultural  considerations  in  knowledge  management, trust factors and human social interactions, communication strategies to promote knowledge  acquisition and learning, knowledge transfer, knowledge selection, updating processes, and change methods  within organizations. In addition, submissions dedicated to knowledge and learning organizations focused on  leadership processes will be accepted. Interdisciplinary contributions connecting related research streams using  innovation,  learning,  unlearning,  and  intentional  forgetting  of  knowledge  (i.e.,  information  systems  and  psychology) are welcome within the IO  minitrack. Fast track to journal publication is encouraged and  discovery will be available at the HICSS author meeting (for example, IJKM or others as indicated by the  subject matter presented).   Contributions from this minitrack of Organizational Learning may include, but are not limited the following  topics:     1.   Organizational learning:   1.1. Individual, group and organizational learning processes  1.2. Knowledge creation, acquisition, transfer, change and forgetting  1.3. Organizational memory and knowledge base  1.4.

Reviewing previous HICSS authors to invite them to submit to this new mini-track   15.  Consider preparing a u-tube and other social media campaign to stir interest  16.  Brainstorming with other Mini-Track Chairs to see what has been effective for them    The Chairs believe that speed of implementation is needed again this year and will encourage reduction of fear  re: COVID -19 and promote the real possibility of an on- ground conference this again this year with consistent  marketing to all scholars.     It is the goal of the Chairs to begin marketing as soon as the proposal is approved and remind submitters that  conference participants can enjoy a safe experience. Conference Providers will need to send this information to  all Chairs and Mini-track Chairs for their use in marketing. CfPs need to be sent out to all contacts, scholars and  universities, followed up by personal invitations and other announcements. This should extend our outreach and  increase number of submissions.      Minitrack Chair:   Julee H.

","KS","HICSS-56","Entrepreneurial Acceleration for Start-ups and Small Enterprises: Understanding the Role of Dominant Stakeholders in Facilitating Entrepreneurial Growth","Technology entrepreneurship seldom thrives in isolation; it usually requires interconnected networks of partners. For entrepreneurs with good technology lacking these networks, incubators and accelerators provide a possible support mechanism for access to partners and non-technological resources. Yet, these relatively recent approaches to supporting technology entrepreneurship are still evolving. Entrepreneurial acceleration is a fast-emerging form of early stage venture support linking innovative start-ups to resources for growth. While sharing common structural elements and components, entrepreneurial acceleration programs differ widely in resource exchange depending on their dominant stakeholders. Specifically, this study identifies and analyzes four dominant stakeholder types, namely investor-based, corporate-based, university-based and government-based accelerators, and six major characterizing variables that express their peculiarities in value creation and value capture.

Yet, much of the current efforts have focused on advancing underlying algorithms and not on decreasing the complexity of AI systems. AI systems are still “black boxes” that are difficult to comprehend—not only for developers, but particularly for users and decision-makers (Meske et al. 2022). In addition, the development and use of AI is associated with many risks and pitfalls like biases in data or predictions based on spurious correlations (“Clever Hans” phenomena) (Lapuschkin et al. 2019), which eventually may lead to malfunctioning or biased AI and hence technologically driven discrimination.  This is where research on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) comes in. Also referred to as “transparent,” “interpretable,” or “understandable AI”, XAI aims to “produce explainable models, while maintaining a high level of learning performance (prediction accuracy); and enable human users to understand, appropriately, trust, and effectively manage the emerging generation of artificially intelligent partners” (DARPA 2017). XAI hence refers to “the movement, initiatives, and efforts made in response to AI transparency and trust concerns, more than to a formal technical concept” (Adadi and Berrada 2018, p. 52140). XAI is designed user-centric in that users are empowered to scrutinize and appropriately trust AI (Förster, Klier, Kluge and Sigler 2020), eventually impacting task performance of users (Kühl, Lobana and Meske 2019). With a focus on decision support, this minitrack aims to explore and extend research on how to establish explainability of intelligent black box systems—machine learning-based or not. We especially look for contributions that investigate XAI from either a developer’s or user’s perspective. We invite submissions from all application domains, such as healthcare, finance, e-commerce, retail, public administration or others. Technically and method-oriented studies, case studies as well as design science or behavioral science approaches are welcome.  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: The users’ perspective on XAI Theorizing XAI-human interactions Presentation and personalization of AI explanations for different target groups XAI to increase situational awareness, compliance behavior and task performance XAI for transparency and unbiased decision making Impact of explainability on AI-based decision support systems use and adoption Explainability of AI in crisis situations Potential harm of explainability in AI Identifying user-centric requirements for XAI systems  The developers’ perspective on XAI XAI to open, control and evaluate black box algorithms Using XAI to identify bias in data Explainability and Human-in-the-Loop development of AI XAI to support interactive machine learning Prevention and detection of deceptive AI explanations XAI to discover deep knowledge and learn from AI Designing and deploying XAI systems Addressing user-centric requirements for XAI systems  The governments’ perspective on XAI XAI and compliance Explainability and transparency policy guidelines  Evidence base benefits and challenges of XAI expectations and implementations  References: Adadi A., Berrada M.

Customer service chatbots redefined the online customer service yet the dissatisfaction from consumers is unavoidable during the conversational interactions for various reasons. Detecting dissatisfaction on conversational interactions with customer service chatbots is therefore examined in this study using a machine learning (ML) approach. To truly uncover the reasons for why dissatisfaction is detected, the determinants of dissatisfaction (i.e., textual linguistic attributes and contextual conversational attributes) are further investigated to make the ML approach explainable. Research findings are expected to contribute to literature on dissatisfaction detection with customer service chatbots and solve the “black box” issue of ML algorithms by identifying the important determinants, and practically increasing the performance of customer service chatbots and alleviating customers’ dissatisfaction attitudes and behaviors."

It goes beyond simple technology adoption, requiring new methods, models, and tools enabling  data-driven business. These changes frequently imply new strategies, identities, new business models, and  adapted  capabilities  to  deal  with  people,  technology,  and  processes  that  advocates  new  ways  of  management and change management. This minitrack aims to discuss how organizations and technology  influence each other during digital transformation. Also, to investigate how organizations are dealing with  the  complexity  generated  by  digital  transformation  at  different  levels  simultaneously.  Theoretical,  methodological, or applied papers are welcome. These may include papers presenting a real case or cases in  any activity sector, for example, papers on - strategies or tools helping organisations to deal with their digital  transformation; practices involved in digital transformation; challenges during the transformation process;  metrics and indicators adopted to measure the success or degree of digital transformation; or other relevant  topics in the area.   Proposed topics include, but are not limited to:  •  DT challenges, drivers, adoption, and barriers  •  DT human resources / technology / corporate strategies  •  DT key performance indicators / success factors / maturity  •  Comparisons between industries and countries  •  Impact on work and changing roles e.g. Data Scientists, Data Citizens, Chief Digital Officers, etc.  •  Frameworks of analyses such as dynamic capabilities, disruption, competitive advantage  •  Methodological reflections such as sociotechnical / sociomaterial approaches or design science  approaches  Research questions, some examples include (but are not limited to):  •  How to prepare middle managers for digital transformation?   •  How to measure the degree of DT?  •  What are strategies to better cope with challenges of DT?  •  How does DT affect corporate strategy and vice versa?  •  How does analytical competence and capability influence DT?  •  Which methodological lenses are needed to come to a higher level of theorization of DT?  •  How to adapt change management to better support successful DT?  •  How does data-driven business and DT influences business models?  •  How are existing business facing DT of the supply chain and partners?   •  How digital supply chain compels organizations to embark in the digital transformation journey?    We expect contributions that will address relevant research questions to the DT process and business model  changes. Exchanges and interactions among authors during the conference will promote fruitful discussions,  perhaps new collaborations. As DT draws heavily from related research domains and seems to be under- theorized in itself, this minitrack will contribute to some theoretical evolution of this relevant research topic.    Journals for fast-track opportunities: There is no opportunity defined by now.  Marketing plan: Similar to the previous years, since 2019 we will share the minitrack call through personal  contacts and newsletters, as well as through established contact with former track participants.

Digital transformation is leading to application of locational data for organizational intelligence and decision making in the areas of business operations, marketing, management information systems, supply chain management and logistics, environment, natural resources, healthcare, retail, sharing economy, public safety, risk mitigation and disaster management, among others. Scholarly research papers are sought that apply a variety of theories and empirical techniques, quantitative, and qualitative, to understand how location, geography, and related data are increasingly important to incorporate into the system sciences. There is a need to develop new theories and modify existing ones for the systems sciences that incorporate spatial data, locational intelligence, and geographical concepts. Current concepts of data science, big data, trust, and privacy need attention in addressing locational intelligence research questions. Marketing plan  For HICSS-56 (2023), the inaugural minitrack on Location Intelligence research (under the invited Track, Location Intelligence) was marketed extensively across academic networks such as the Association for Information Systems (AIS), INFORMS, American Association of Geographers (AAG), and ACM. Specifically, members of Special Interest Groups such as SIG-Geographic Information System (SIGGIS) and SIG-Decision Support and Analytics (SIGDSA) of AIS, SIGSpatial of ACM, the Business Geography Specialty Group of AAG were targeted. A comprehensive Call for Papers was also circulated in the HigherEd listserv of Esri, the largest location intelligence company worldwide. This marketing strategy drew significant interest in the inaugural Location Intelligence Research minitrack from academics and industry professionals in diverse areas such as transportation planning and management, geospatial big data analytics, geo-blockchain, location privacy, and economic development.  The minitrack co-authors will follow a similar marketing plan for this HICSS-55 minitrack. In addition, minitrack co-chairs will also reach out to their own network of research contacts in areas such as geographic information systems (GIS), Geography, GIScience, Computer Science, etc. The minitrack will be also be marketed to healthcare related SIGs (for example, Health Applications Society at INFORMS, and SIG-Health of AIS) this year, in light of the proliferating use of human mobility data and location-based analytics by researchers in many areas to model, analyze, and forecast spatial patterns and diffusion of COVID-19. The minitrack’s Call for Papers will be circulated via listservs of the aforementioned SIGs and Specialty Groups on a biweekly basis.

LBS, however, is not the only way to co-create value by using location information, as LBS does not target immovable objects, such as infrastructure. Informed by a literature review, we set out to conceptualize a new class of service complementing LBS—Location-Enhanced Service (LES). LES focuses on improving existing service, based on enabling users with static positions to retrieve and analyze data on immovable objects. We describe the conceptual properties of LES vis- ́a-vis LBS and outline why we see Geographic Information System (GIS) as a crucial class of systems to enable LES. We discuss why LES highlights new aspects and shifts research priorities that constitute the LBS and GIS fields today."

Therefore, a high maturity level of KM research has been achieved. However, organizational knowledge/KM initiatives are more and more faced with budget cuts and justification demands due to intense competition in today’s business environments. The influences of the rapid pace of globalization and of the ongoing liberalization of national and international markets lead to the emergence of increased pressure on existing companies. Project managers of knowledge/KM initiatives like Chief Knowledge Officers need to justify their budgets and, thus, are in need of qualitative and quantitative evidence of the initiatives’ success. In addition, ROI calculations and traditional accounting approaches do not tell an adequate story when proposing knowledge-based initiatives. This minitrack explores research into strategies, methodologies, and stories that relate to measuring this success. In addition, this minitrack will be used to explore the bodies of performance measurements that define the current state of research in measuring knowledge system, KM, organizational memory, and organizational learning success. Eventually, another purpose of this minitrack is to present research on how to value knowledge-based initiatives.  Possible Paper Topics: Frameworks and models for assessing knowledge systems, knowledge management, and/or organizational memory systems Methodologies and processes for measuring knowledge systems, knowledge management and/or organizational memory success and performance Impact of knowledge use, knowledge management strategy, organization, systems, culture, and other issues on knowledge management/organizational memory success Organizational effectiveness/efficiency due to knowledge management/organizational memory/organizational learning, knowledge and organizational memory use Knowledge systems, knowledge management, organizational memory, and organizational learning metrics Knowledge systems, knowledge management, organizational memory, and organizational learning success factors and key performance indicators Benchmarking of knowledge systems/knowledge management/organizational memory initiatives Case studies of knowledge systems, knowledge management and organizational memory success and performance measurements Measuring knowledge systems, knowledge management and/or organizational memory performance in global organizations and globally dispersed communities Effectiveness and/or efficiency of knowledge systems/knowledge management/organizational memory systems and/or innovation, entrepreneurship and crowd systems Modeling and measuring the impact of social software on knowledge system/knowledge management performance Measuring the effects and value of AI and AR implementations in/for organizations Measuring the role and impact of diversity in knowledge systems/knowledge management/organizational memory systems Defining knowledge systems, knowledge management and organizational memory success Rigorous anecdotes and user stories and their theoretical basis to facilitate the value of knowledge-based initiatives Developing grounded theory approaches to valuing knowledge-based initiatives Understanding knowledge-based initiatives’ activities and output as service offerings and exploring their productivity Usage, adoption and success of knowledge management methods  Coverage in other Conferences: Knowledge management is a very popular IS research topic, and has received attention at most academic conferences in Information Systems. However, this minitrack is unique in the sense that it strives to investigate value, performance and success measurements of knowledge systems, knowledge management, organizational memory, and respective systems. Additionally, the 28-years history of the original KM/OM Implementation and other Issues minitrack at HICSS makes it one of the oldest and most established outlets for scholars and academics working in these areas.  3. Continuation of a current research area: This minitrack represents a continuation of the topics addressed in knowledge systems, knowledge management, organizational memory, and organizational learning in past HICSS conferences. The popularity of this topic has been proved by the high number of paper submissions, high quality presentations, high attendance numbers, and sustained interest in the area. We expect the minitrack will continue the evolution of knowledge systems, knowledge management, organizational memory, and organizational learning discipline.

Research suggests that IT and research and development (R&D), as key organizational resources, are critical for a firm’s knowledge creation. However, little is known about corporate forces that guide a firm's knowledge creation efforts for exploitative and exploratory innovation types. In this paper, we examine the synergy between IT, R&D, and BOD’s social capital and their impacts on a firm’s knowledge creation through exploitative and exploratory innovation. Using a 2005 to 2017 panel dataset of 2,151 publicly traded US firms, we show IT, R&D, and BOD’s social capital individually contributes to exploitative and exploratory knowledge creation productivity. Moreover, IT and R&D enhance knowledge creation productivity enabled by BOD’s social capital."

In the last decade, esport has ceased to be seen solely as entertainment for  the youth and has become the fastest-growing sports area. This view is supported by the  increase in the number of events organized, their popularity among millions of viewers, and  the growing number and professionalization of gamers. Traditional sports are still bigger than  the biggest esports, making more revenue or player salaries. However, esports is quickly  catching up, given the growing number of broadcasted games, tournament prize pools, and  increasing advertising potential of esports games. Despite the increasing popularity of esports,  the research is still in its nascency. After an initial descriptive stage, the focus shifts from  explaining what esports is to a more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon.     This minitrack aims to provide insight into esports’ theoretical development and practical  understanding without excluding any methodological approach or scientific disciplines.  Conceptual, theoretical, empirical, and methodological contributions that enrich our  understanding of esports are welcome.     Given the diverse goals of this minitrack, possible topics include, but are not limited to:    •  Business, e.g. discovering esports consumers’ motivations; designing effective  marketing tools; understanding players’/esports’ networks and organizations;  gamers/fans as consumers.  •  Cognitive Science/Psychology, e.g. studying factors influencing athletes’  performance; their abilities and skills; cognitive and behavioral differences between  athletes.   •  IT, e.g. using game telemetry, biometrics, user-generated data, or text mining to study  esports, e.g. team dynamics, interactions of players; in-game performance.  •  Law, e.g. copyright issues   •  Sociology, e.g. gamers’ and athletes’ interactions and identities; live events and  streaming dynamics; gender issues (gender gap).  •  Media Studies, e.g. relations between esports, traditional sports, and the media; offline  spaces versus live-streaming, understanding esports in terms of virtual versus real;  how technology mediates gaming, and how esports’ communities fit here.  •  Sports Science, e.g., comparing esports and ‘traditional’ sports; esports as ‘real’,  ‘genuine’ sports or new quality.           Journals for fast track opportunities, if any:      Journal of Electronic Gaming and Esports       Marketing plan:    •  Using research networks and various associations, e.g. Esports Research Network;  Association of Internet Researchers; National Communication Association;  International Communication Association, European Communication Research and  Education Association.  •  Esports research journals (e.g. JEGE), conferences and communities.  •  Grassroots activism in this area.

Through techno-logical developments since the introduction of the Internet, platforms became a ubiquitous commodity in the business world. Companies like Uber and Airbnb disrupted their markets and, still, there is no concise defini-tion of platform economy available. This ambiguity indicates that there are differences in platform econo-mies. Based on that assumption, we derive a 2x2 matrix to explain the different stages and test the potential evolutionary paths in the platform economy. We utilize the case of the video game platform economy Battle.net, a platform introduced in 1996 that has evolved quite manifold. The goal of this paper is to present an argument that there is an evolution of plat-form economies and that within an existing platform, the strategy may differ. This leads to the paradigm that strategy follows the platform culture."

While many of the research initiatives have been undertaken in Western Europe and North America, they have been scarce in developing regions like Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The diffusion of collaboration technologies in these regions is on the rise as globalization drives inter and intra-country collaboration intensity within and across organizations. In many developing countries, synchronous and asynchronous computer support for team members (co-located or virtual) is being enhanced by handheld mobile devices in communities of practice and social media environments. Moreover, during this era of COVID-19, the use of digital technology enabled tools for collaboration and communication, is becoming the new normal. Emerging trends like Metaverse, provide opportunities to further enhance IT enabled collaboration for development. We would like to invite the authors to submit their research from theoretical, technological, social, psychological, behavioral, and design science perspectives. Research deploying different theoretical lenses could focus on process and system design, methods, modeling, and techniques in addressing various aspects of IT enabled collaboration for development. The minitrack will focus on a wide range of topics including but not limited to: IT enabled collaboration in emerging context (COVID-19 period, Metaverse) in developing regions Collaboration technology diffusion case studies in education, business, government, and healthcare organizations in developing regions IT enabled cross-cultural and intra and/or inter-organizational collaboration in developing regions Global, virtual, distributed, blended, and face-to-face IT enabled collaboration for development at the team and organizational level Emerging issues in collaboration technology diffusion for development Deployment of mobile technologies for collaboration in developing regions Group decision making, negotiation, facilitation, and communication technologies for development Trust, privacy, security issues in IT enabled collaboration for development Social, behavioral, psychological, and technical factors influencing IT enabled collaboration for development Information systems, technologies, theories, processes, methods, or models that could be transferred and applied from developed regions to developing regions  (3) Name, affiliation, and contact information of minitrack chair (primary contact) and co-chair(s)  Mini-track Co-Chairs Xusen Cheng (Primary Contact) School of Information  Renmin University of China Zhongguancun dajie 59, Haidian,Beijing, China, 100872 Telephone: +86-10-62513624 Email:   Xiangbin Yan School of Economics and Management, University of Science & Technology Beijing  No. 30 Xueyuan Road, Haidian District, Beijing, China, 100083  Telephone: +86-10-62332744 Fax: +86-10-62334699 Email: xbyan@ustb.edu.cn  Deepinder S.

","CL","HICSS-56","Live Streaming: Its Relevant Concepts and Literature Review","Live streaming is a new form of social applications involving video content, consumption and real-time human interaction to facilitate users’ ability to interact with each other. Despite the increasing popularity of live streaming and its influence on business and society, relatively little research has been conducted to understand what we know and what we need to know about it. Therefore, a systematic review of the existing literature was carried out to synthesize the research findings. Accordingly, we systematically reviewed 133 useable papers published across 52 academic journals and 10 conferences with regards to research trends, topics, methodology, and contexts. This study offers a thorough understanding of current practices in live streaming, which may help businesses to better realize their live streaming deployment objectives."

If your proposal is accepted, this will be included in the HICSS-56 website  The Advances in Teaching and Learning Technologies (ATLT) minitrack encourages research  contributions that deal with learning theories, teaching tools and their development, distance  learning, supporting infrastructures, user experiences and feedback, learning analytics and  measurable outcomes as they relate to the area of technology and its support of improving  teaching and learning. Especially, the current increasing demand on hybrid learning and emerging  remote learning models have challenged multidisciplinary research for advancing the design,  development, and implementation of effective teaching and learning technologies. Furthermore,  the recent progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other advanced technologies have  brought  novel  opportunities  for  transforming  the  education  landscape.  The  use  of  AI  and  advanced technologies into learning environments invites new questions,  applications, and  research methodologies. How, for example, does technology integration and remote teaching  augment how people learn?, and Can we effectively develop agency, trust, analytics, feedback,  and interventions to support learning in complex environments where boundaries between human  and artificial cognition and knowledge processes become blurred? What new capability and  research will this integration bring and how will it advance our current understanding of learning?  To leverage the HICSS context, we seek to bridge disciplines and research communities between  system sciences, AI, computer and learning sciences, so within this scope a broad range of  research questions, learning settings, and theoretical and methodological traditions will be  considered. We are flexible about what constitutes 'learning' (e.g., acquisition or co-creation of  knowledge or skills, intersubjective meaning-making, advancing community and network learning,   collective change) and about the nature of the setting (e.g., face-to-face or online; formal or    informal; educational, workplace or leisure and mixtures thereof; with diverse technological media  and artificial intelligence mediating networked or community social interaction), but learning and  the Collaboration Systems and Technology setting should be considered in relation to each other  rather than one without regard for the other.    Papers should make a theoretical and/ or empirical contribution or establish the value of a  methodological or design innovation: it is not sufficient to merely document use of a technology  in a learning context or apply a well-worn model without new insights.          *Shortened version to be included in the Advance Program Announcement.  The Advances in Teaching and Learning Technologies (ATLT) minitrack encourages paper  submissions that deal with theories, tools, platforms, infrastructures, experiences, methods, or  outcomes as they relate to the area of innovative technology, learning analytics and its support of  the  learning  and  development  process  in  educational,  workplace  and  leisure  settings.    In  particular, the current shift to online teaching and learning brought new methodological and  technological  challenges.  This  change  requires  innovative  ways  to  bring  students  and  professionals together, improve collaboration and learning experiences, and support diverse  learning settings.      *Marketing Plan  The ATLT community has grown considerably in the last several years. Our LinkedIn group  HICSS-ATLT (https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13862522/) has already 70+ members. We also  disseminate our minitrack information via Academia and Researchgate and to learning research  communities such as the Society for Learning Analytics Research and Networked Learning.

It is an understatement to say that teaching effective and gamified Cybersecurity courses amidst the COVID19 pandemic placed an extreme pressure on faculty. In general, this is true for any academic area which has a strong hands-on component tied to their theoretical counterpart.  While Zoom,  WebEx, and Google Classroom virtual meeting were sufficient for some, others were in pursuit of platforms which could address the hands-on interaction component that happens in a class setting while isolating and/or removing some of the distractive and engagement-adverse ingredients that occur in traditional remote meeting platforms.  To this end, we present and evaluate a framework for teaching effective and gamified Cybersecurity courses through a blended physio-digital environment based on the Metaverse paradigm.  We first survey the state-of-the-art in virtual learning ecosystem and provide the introduction and motivation for a proposed Metaverse classroom.  We focus and elaborate on on a specific model which has the capability and versatility to enhance Cybersecurity teaching through a gamified methodology in the Metaverse.  We provide concrete evaluation metrics on its effectiveness when used towards Cybersecurity gamified remote learning and provide future research directions towards the ultimate goal of metamorphosing traditional Cybersecurity classrooms into fun, gamified, and engaging remote classrooms on the Metaverse."

Companies  must ensure leveraging data to optimize internal business processes and create new business opportunities. That  applies to traditional incumbents and digital natives alike. The former must ensure to stay competitive and avoid  losing touch with the changing market, for example, by using data from physical assets (e.g., machines) to offer  new digital services. The latter can leverage the green-field advantage and generate completely novel solutions  from scratch, such as establishing data ecosystems that enable different actors (e.g., public institutions, companies,  academia) to share data for reciprocal benefit. With this comes a set of challenges. For example, unlike physical  assets, data are reproducible at almost zero marginal cost and technical effort.   The track focuses on exploring the fundamentals of data ecosystems from multiple perspectives, including studies  that discover the meaning of data sharing in ecosystems for its stakeholders (e.g., data producers, providers, or  consumers) or the classification of ecosystems. We expect contributions examining issues relating to the business  value of data ecosystems within different domains (e.g., mobility, healthcare, manufacturing, logistics) and the use  of various underpinning technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence or blockchain). Complementarily, we invite  contributions exploring data sharing as well as the associated rules and governance mechanisms. Lastly, we like  to encourage submission tackling socially relevant challenges by means of data ecosystems, such as sustainability  (17 Sustainable Development Goals), security, and privacy.  The track ‘Data Ecosystems in Information Systems’ invites papers investigating the field of data ecosystems both  empirically and theoretically, such as (but not limited to):  •  Classifications of data ecosystems and data sharing mechanisms  •  Paradigmatic differences between data ecosystems and traditional business networks  •  Analysis of domain-specific characteristics of data ecosystems   •  Analysis of technology-specific characteristics of data ecosystems   •  Design and modeling of data ecosystems  •  Business models in data ecosystems  •  Impact of data ecosystems on stakeholders  •  Data sharing fundamentals  •  Data sovereignty and usage control policies in data ecosystems  •  Economic, ecological, and social sustainability of data ecosystems     Keywords: Data Ecosystems, Design Science, Data Sharing        Marketing Plan     Marketing channel        LinkedIn  We will use both our private profiles that are well connected in the community and  the corresponding profiles of our chairs to publicize the track. We plan to place three  posts each at the opening of the submission, in the middle, and two weeks apart at the  deadline. We anticipate more than 2000 unique views per post.      WKWI  Wissenschaftliche Kommission Wirtschaftsinformatik (WKWI) is the largest  association of researchers in the discipline in the German-speaking region. We plan  to place three announcements about this during the submission period.      Fraunhofer  The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft for the Advancement of Applied Research is the largest  organization for applied research and development services in Europe, with around  29,000 employees and 2.8 billion in revenue. We will leverage this to promote the  track across disciplines.      University Mailing- We use the university-wide mailing lists of the TU Dortmund, the University of  List & News  Duisburg-Essen, and Hildesheim. Furthermore, the track will be shared via university  news on the chair and faculty level to address researchers within the discipline and  related disciplines directly.
